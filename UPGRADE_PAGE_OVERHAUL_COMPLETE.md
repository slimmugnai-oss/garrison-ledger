# Upgrade Page Comprehensive Overhaul - COMPLETE

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete  
**Version:** 6.0

---

## Overview

Successfully redesigned `/dashboard/upgrade` to offer both Premium subscription options AND Ask Assistant question packs with a clean, military-professional aesthetic. Fixed the Free vs Premium comparison table and ensured all Stripe integrations work correctly.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Updated SSOT (Single Source of Truth)

**File:** `lib/ssot.ts`

Added comprehensive pricing configuration:

```typescript
pricing: {
  subscription: {
    monthly: {
      priceUSD: 9.99,
      priceId: process.env.STRIPE_PREMIUM_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID || '',
      productId: 'prod_TE5hK7gmtxzx1R'
    },
    annual: {
      priceUSD: 99,
      priceId: process.env.STRIPE_PREMIUM_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID || '',
      productId: 'prod_TE5hK7gmtxzx1R',
      savings: 20
    }
  },
  questionPacks: {
    pack25: { questions: 25, priceUSD: 1.99, priceId: '...', perQuestionCost: 0.0796 },
    pack100: { questions: 100, priceUSD: 5.99, priceId: '...', perQuestionCost: 0.0599 },
    pack250: { questions: 250, priceUSD: 9.99, priceId: '...', perQuestionCost: 0.03996 }
  }
}
```

### 2. Created New UI Components

#### BillingPeriodToggle Component
**File:** `app/components/BillingPeriodToggle.tsx`

- Clean toggle between monthly and annual billing
- Shows $20 savings badge for annual option
- Blue button styling for active period

#### QuestionPackCard Component
**File:** `app/components/QuestionPackCard.tsx`

- Displays question pack size, price, and per-question cost
- Optional "Best Value" badge for most popular pack
- Integrated PaymentButton for seamless checkout

### 3. Redesigned Upgrade Page

#### Server Component
**File:** `app/dashboard/upgrade/page.tsx`

- Checks if user is already premium (shows billing portal)
- Passes SSOT pricing data to client component
- Maintains clean server/client separation

#### Client Component
**File:** `app/dashboard/upgrade/UpgradePageClient.tsx`

**New Page Structure:**
```
├── Hero Section
│   ├── "Upgrade to Premium"
│   └── "Or buy Ask Assistant question credits as needed"
│
├── Premium Subscription Card (Primary)
│   ├── Billing Period Toggle (Monthly/Annual)
│   ├── Dynamic Pricing Display
│   ├── 6 Premium Benefits with Icons
│   │   ├── Unlimited LES Audits
│   │   ├── Full Base Navigator
│   │   ├── Unlimited TDY Receipts
│   │   ├── 50 Ask Assistant Questions/Month ⭐ NEW

│   │   ├── Pack 100 marked as "Best Value"

    ├── Binder Storage: 1GB → 5GB
    ├── Intel Library: Basic → All premium
    └── Calculators: ✓ All 6 → ✓ All 6 ⭐ FIXED
```

### 4. Updated Stripe Checkout API

**File:** `app/api/stripe/create-checkout-session/route.ts`

**Key Changes:**
- Automatic mode detection based on price ID prefix
  - `price_1SHd*` → subscription mode (premium monthly/annual)
  - `price_1SLS*` → payment mode (question packs)
- Stores `checkoutMode` in session metadata for webhook processing
- Referral credits only applied to subscriptions (not question packs)
- Updated success/cancel URLs to new domain (`www.garrisonledger.com`)

### 5. Webhook Handler Already Complete

**File:** `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`

Already handles question pack purchases:
- Detects one-time payments (no subscription)
- Maps price IDs to pack sizes (25, 100, 250)
- Records purchase in `ask_credit_purchases` table
- Adds credits to user's `ask_credits` account
- Creates new credit record if user doesn't have one yet
