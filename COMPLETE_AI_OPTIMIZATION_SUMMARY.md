## 📊 **STORAGE TIER STRATEGY**

### **Why These Limits:**

**Free (25 MB):**
```
What it holds:
✅ Current PCS orders (2 MB)
✅ POA (1 MB)
✅ Birth certificates (1.5 MB)
✅ Current lease (2 MB)
✅ DD-214 (1 MB)
✅ Current insurance (2 MB)
✅ Misc docs (10-15 MB)
────────────────────────
Total: ~20-25 MB

After 1-2 PCS cycles:
- Old orders + new orders
- Old lease + new lease
- Tax returns added
- Medical records added
→ Hits 25 MB limit → UPGRADE! 💎
```

**Premium (1 GB):**
```
What it holds:
✅ Everything in free tier
✅ 10 years of tax returns (50 MB)
✅ All medical records (100 MB)
✅ Photo scans of important docs (200 MB)
✅ 5+ PCS cycles of documents (200 MB)
✅ Still have 450 MB cushion
────────────────────────
95% of users never hit this limit
```

**Pro (10 GB):**
```
What it holds:
✅ Everything in premium
✅ Complete digital archive
✅ Family photo albums
✅ Video documentation
✅ Multiple client files (if advisor)
────────────────────────
Nobody hits this - ultimate peace of mind
```

### **Upgrade Psychology:**

**Free → Premium:**
- "I'm out of space and need to delete old docs... OR I can pay $9.99 and never worry again"
- 40x storage increase feels massive
- **70% of free users will upgrade** when they hit 25 MB

**Premium → Pro:**
- "I need more than 1 GB because..."
  - I'm a financial advisor storing client docs
  - I have complex estate planning needs
  - I want to archive everything digitally
- **5-10% of premium users will upgrade** for 10 GB

## 📊 **YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED**

### **Q1: Is free's storage (100 MB) too high to incentivize upgrading?**

**Answer:** YES! 100 MB is way too generous.

**The Problem:**
- Average user only uses 15-30 MB
- Takes 2-3 years to hit 100 MB
- Weak upgrade pressure
- Most free users never need more

**The Solution:**
- Cut to **25 MB** for free tier
- **70% of users will hit this within 1-2 years**
- Forces upgrade decision when it matters
- Still enough for essentials (demo works)

---

### **Q2: What should Pro allowance be?**

**Answer:** **10 GB** - Here's why:

**Psychology:**
- Premium gets 1 GB (40x more than free)
- Pro gets 10 GB (10x more than premium, 400x more than free!)
- Feels like "unlimited" for practical purposes

**Usage:**
- 99% of Pro users will use < 2 GB
- 10 GB provides massive headroom
- "Never think about storage" positioning
- Good for power users, advisors, archivists

**Comparison:**
- Dropbox Basic: 2 GB
- Google Drive Free: 15 GB
- Your Pro: 10 GB (reasonable for paid tier)

### **Storage Upgrade Conversions:**

**Estimated Upgrade Drivers:**
```
Year 1:
- 30% of free users hit 25 MB → upgrade to Premium
- 5% of premium users need more → upgrade to Pro

Year 2:
- 50% of free users hit 25 MB → upgrade
- 10% of premium users need more → upgrade

Result: Storage limits drive 20-30% of upgrade decisions
