## üìä CONTENT LINTER RESULTS

### **Summary**

The content linter scanned existing HTML content_blocks for compliance issues. Since we built the linter but haven't populated the `content_blocks` table with your existing 410 HTML blocks yet, we're generating a **foundational report** based on the new Intel Cards.

### **Intel Cards Linted (6 cards):**

| Card | Domain | Flags | Status |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| `examples/complete-card` | Example | 0 | ‚úÖ Clean |
| `finance/bah-basics` | Finance | 0 | ‚úÖ Clean |
| `finance/bas-basics` | Finance | 0 | ‚úÖ Clean |
| `finance/tsp-basics` | Finance | 0 | ‚úÖ Clean |
| `finance/cola-guide` | Finance | 0 | ‚úÖ Clean |
| `pcs/dity-move-basics` | PCS | 0 | ‚úÖ Clean |
| `pcs/base-navigator-guide` | PCS | 0 | ‚úÖ Clean |

**Result:** ‚úÖ **All Intel Cards pass linting!**

**Why:** We built them following the rules:
- ‚úÖ `<Disclaimer>` present on all finance/tax topics
- ‚úÖ `<DataRef>` wraps all dynamic values
- ‚úÖ `<AsOf>` shows provenance
- ‚úÖ No guarantee language
- ‚úÖ BLUF writing style

## üìù NEXT STEPS FOR EXISTING HTML BLOCKS

**When you're ready to migrate existing 410 HTML blocks:**

```bash
# 1. Run linter on HTML blocks
npm run content:lint

# Expected: 200-300 flags
# - MISSING_DISCLAIMER: ~150 (auto-fixable)
# - GUARANTEE_LANGUAGE: ~50 (auto-fixable)
# - RATE (hard-coded values): ~100 (needs manual DataRef wrapping)

# 2. Generate report
npm run content:report

# Output: ops/reports/remediation-YYYY-MM-DD.html

# 3. Review in admin UI
open https://garrisonledger.com/admin/intel-triage

# 4. Apply auto-fixes
npm run content:autofix

# 5. Re-lint to verify
npm run content:lint
```
