## ✅ What's COMPLETE

### Database Layer (100% Done)
- ✅ Added 4 computed fields: `paygrade`, `rank_category`, `mha_code`, `duty_location_type`
- ✅ Removed 20 unused fields from database schema
- ✅ Backfilled your profile with correct values:
  - `paygrade: "E01"` (from Private)
  - `mha_code: "NY349"` (from West Point)
  - `rank_category: "enlisted"`
  - `has_dependents: true`
- ✅ Added indexes for performance
- ✅ **43 columns remain (down from 63+)**

### Mapping Infrastructure (100% Done)
- ✅ `lib/data/rank-paygrade-map.ts` - Pattern matching for all ranks
- ✅ `lib/data/base-mha-map.json` - 50+ bases → MHA codes
- ✅ `lib/data/base-mha-helpers.ts` - Lookup functions

### Profile Form Auto-Derivations (100% Done)

## ⏸️ What's REMAINING

### UI Cleanup (Still Has Old Fields)

**Problem:** Profile form UI still shows all 30+ fields, including the 20 removed from database

**Errors:** TypeScript compilation fails because form tries to use removed fields:
- Line 167: `education_level`
- Line 393-394: Section 7 education completion calculator
- Line 398-399: Section 8 preferences completion calculator
- Lines 1350-1400: Education section UI
- Lines 1400+: Preferences section UI

**Fix Needed:** Remove UI sections for deleted fields

### Sections to Remove from UI
1. **Section 7: Education** (lines ~1350-1400)
   - education_level dropdown
   - education_goals multi-select
   
2. **Section 8: Preferences** (lines ~1400+)
   - content_difficulty_pref
   - communication_pref
   - urgency_level
   - timezone

3. **Section 4 (Family) - Simplify**
   - Remove: spouse_age, spouse_career_field, spouse_employed
   - Remove: children ages array
   - Keep: marital_status, num_children, spouse_military, has_efmp

4. **Section 2 (Military) - Simplify**
   - Remove: clearance_level, mos_afsc_rate

5. **Section 3 (Location) - Simplify**
   - Remove: deployment_status, last_deployment_date

6. **Section 5 (Financial) - Simplify**
   - Remove: emergency_fund_range, tsp_allocation, monthly_income_range, bah_amount

## Quick Fix vs Full Redesign

### Option A: Quick Fix (1 hour)
- Remove fields from ProfilePayload type
- Comment out UI sections (don't delete yet)
- Make form pass TypeScript
- Test basic save functionality

### Option B: Full UI Redesign (3-4 hours)
- Remove all unused fields from type
- Delete UI sections entirely
- Reorganize into clean 3-section form:
  - Section 1: Military (5 fields)
  - Section 2: Location (2 fields)
  - Section 3: Family (3 fields)
  - Section 4: Financial (Optional, 5 fields)
- Update progress calculator
- Polish UX

## Recommendation

**For NOW (Quick Fix):**
Just remove the fields from the type and comment out the UI sections so it compiles and deploys. The form still works, just has some dead fields temporarily.

**For LATER (Full Redesign):**
Schedule a dedicated session to properly redesign the UI to be the clean 15-question form.

**Immediate Need:**
Fix TypeScript errors so we can deploy what we have (database is already cleaned up).

Would you like me to:
1. Do quick fix now (remove from type, comment out UI sections) → 30 min
2. Do full UI redesign now → 3-4 hours
3. Or test what we have first, fix UI later?
