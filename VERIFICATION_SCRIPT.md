#   ],
#   "summary": { "total": 6, "ok": 6, "stale": 0, "error": 0 }
# }

# 2. Manual feed refresh (REQUIRES CRON_SECRET)
# Replace YOUR_SECRET with actual CRON_SECRET from Vercel
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET" \
  "https://garrisonledger.com/api/feeds/refresh?source=BAH"

# Expected:
# {"success":true,"refreshed":1,"errors":0,...}
```

---

## üìù STEP 3: Verify Intel Cards Load (5 minutes)

Open these URLs in browser:

# Expected:
# - Page renders MDX correctly
# - <DataRef> shows live values (not "Unavailable")
# - <AsOf> badges show source links
# - <Disclaimer> renders at top

# 3. BAH Intel Card
open https://garrisonledger.com/dashboard/intel/finance/bah-basics

# Expected:
# - <RateBadge> shows live BAH rates
# - Rates match sample data (E06/WA408 = $2,598.00, etc.)
# - Provenance shows "DFAS BAH Rates, As of 2025-01-01"

# 4. TSP Intel Card
open https://garrisonledger.com/dashboard/intel/finance/tsp-basics

# Expected:
# - TSP limits show $23,500, $7,500, $69,000
# - Source: IRS / TSP.gov
# - <Disclaimer kind="finance"> at top

# 5. DITY Move card (PCS Copilot integration)
open https://garrisonledger.com/dashboard/intel/pcs/dity-move-basics

# Expected:
# - Mileage rate shows $0.70/mile
# - Link to PCS Copilot present
# - <DataRef> resolves correctly
```

---

## üé® STEP 4: Verify Admin UIs (5 minutes)

**NOTE:** Requires admin authentication

```bash
# 1. Feeds Management Dashboard
open https://garrisonledger.com/admin/feeds

# Expected:
# - 6 feeds listed (BAH, BAS, COLA, IRS_TSP_LIMITS, TRICARE_COSTS, MILEAGE_RATE)
# - Status shows "ok" or "stale"
# - Last refresh times visible
# - "Refresh Now" buttons functional

# 2. Content Triage Dashboard
open https://garrisonledger.com/admin/intel-triage

# Expected:
# - Shows unresolved flags (if any)
# - Filter by severity/type/domain
# - "Mark Resolved" buttons functional
# - Stats dashboard at top
```

---

## ‚è∞ STEP 5: Verify Cron Jobs (Next Day)

**Wait until after 3AM UTC (tomorrow)**, then:

```bash
# Check Vercel Dashboard Logs
# 1. Go to: https://vercel.com/slimmugnai-oss/garrison-ledger
# 2. Click "Logs"
# 3. Filter by: /api/feeds/refresh
# 4. Look for entries at:
#    - 3:00 AM UTC (BAH, COLA)
#    - 4:00 AM UTC (IRS_TSP_LIMITS)
#    - 5:00 AM UTC Sunday (TRICARE, BAS, MILEAGE_RATE)

# Check feed status shows recent refresh
curl https://garrisonledger.com/api/feeds/status | jq '.feeds[] | {source: .sourceKey, lastRefresh: .lastRefreshAt, status: .status}'

# Expected: All feeds show lastRefreshAt within last 24 hours
```

---

## üß™ STEP 6: End-to-End Integration Test (10 minutes)

### **Test: LES Auditor ‚Üí Intel Cards**

1. Navigate to: `/dashboard/paycheck-audit`
2. Upload sample LES with BAH entry
3. If BAH mismatch flag appears:
   - Look for "Learn more" link
   - Should link to: `/dashboard/intel/finance/bah-basics`
4. Click link, verify Intel Card loads with correct BAH data

### **Test: PCS Copilot ‚Üí Intel Cards**

1. Navigate to: `/dashboard/pcs-copilot`
2. Start a DITY move claim
3. Check mileage calculation uses: <DataRef source="MILEAGE_RATE" />
4. Verify rate matches Intel Card: `/dashboard/intel/pcs/dity-move-basics`

### **Test: Base Navigator ‚Üí Intel Cards**

1. Navigate to: `/base-guides` (select any base)
2. Look for Intel Card sidebar (future enhancement)
3. Should show relevant cards: BAH basics, COLA guide, housing hunt
