# Weather & Schools API Fix Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Weather Display Issue** âœ… FIXED
**Problem:** Weather showing `[object Object]` instead of description
**Root Cause:** Wrong field parsing for Google Weather API response
**Fix:** Updated parsing to use correct structure:
- `data.temperature.degrees` (not `.value`)
- `data.weatherCondition.description.text` (not direct object)

**Result:** Weather now shows: `"Current: 62Â°F, 50% humidity, Sunny"`

### **2. Schools Debug Issue** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Problem:** Schools cached, can't see fresh debug output for rating issue
**Fix:** Added force refresh in development mode
**Result:** Will now fetch fresh data and show debug output

---

## ðŸ§ª **What To Test Now**

### **1. Weather (Should Work)**
- âœ… Go to Base Navigator
- âœ… Check weather display - should show proper description
- âœ… Should see: `"Current: 62Â°F, 50% humidity, Sunny"` (not `[object Object]`)

### **2. Schools (Debug Mode)**
- âœ… Go to Base Navigator  
- âœ… Check Vercel logs for fresh debug output
- âœ… Look for: `[Schools] ðŸ”„ Force refresh for ZIP 23505 (debugging mode)`
- âœ… Look for: `[Schools] DEBUG: First school data: { ... }`

---

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Log Output**

**Weather (should work now):**
```
[Weather] âœ… Weather fetched for ZIP 23505: Current: 62Â°F, 50% humidity, Sunny
```

**Schools (fresh debug):**
```
[Schools] ðŸ”„ Force refresh for ZIP 23505 (debugging mode)
[Schools] DEBUG: First school data: {
  "name": "Granby Elementary School",
  "rating-band": "Above Average",  // <-- This is what we need to see
  "level": "elementary",
  ...
}
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps**

1. **Test weather display** - should be fixed
2. **Check schools debug output** - share the JSON structure
3. **Fix schools rating parsing** - once we see the actual field names
4. **Remove force refresh** - after debugging is complete

---

## ðŸ”§ **Environment Variables Status**

- âœ… `GOOGLE_WEATHER_API_KEY` - Working (weather fetching successfully)
- âœ… `GREAT_SCHOOLS_API_KEY` - Working (schools fetching, just parsing issue)

---

**Deployment:** `0be7306` - Weather fix + Schools debug mode
