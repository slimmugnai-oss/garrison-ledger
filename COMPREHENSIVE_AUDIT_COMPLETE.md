## 📋 FIXES DEPLOYED (5 Major Improvements)

### **1. Schools API - State Mapping Fix** ✅
**Problem:** Fort Liberty (Bragg) schools API broken (400 Bad Request)  
**Root Cause:** ZIP 28303 mapped to 'DC' instead of 'NC'  
**Fix:** Comprehensive 50-state ZIP-to-state mapping  
**Commit:** `a96d2f7`  
**Result:** Schools API works for ALL bases nationwide

---

### **2. Schools Counting - Unique Logic** ✅
**Problem:** K-12 schools counted 3x (elem + middle + high)  
**Root Cause:** categorizeByGrade() created duplicates  
**Fix:** Deduplication by school name per grade level  
**Commit:** `28ef59c`  
**Result:** Accurate counts, no duplicates

---

### **3. Verbiage Accuracy - Grammar** ✅
**Problem:** "1 schools in area" (grammar error)  
**Root Cause:** No pluralization logic  
**Fix:** Added `{count !== 1 ? 's' : ''}` conditionals  
**Commit:** `28ef59c`  
**Result:** Perfect grammar throughout

---

### **4. Housing Tab - Property Listings** ✅
**Problem:** "Random light blotchy info" - no actual properties shown  
**Root Cause:** sample_listings data existed but wasn't displayed  
**Fix:** Complete redesign with property cards, photos, links  
**Commit:** `abfe4a9`  
**Result:** Professional real estate UI with clickable listings

---

### **5. Amenities Sorting - Quality Score** ✅
**Problem:** 5★ with 1 review beat 4.8★ with 500 reviews  
**Root Cause:** Sorted by rating only  
**Fix:** Quality score = rating × log10(reviews + 1)  
**Commit:** `dd02493`  
**Result:** Substantial reviews + high ratings win
