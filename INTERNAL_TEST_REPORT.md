---

## Test Suite 1: Code Canonicalization ✅

Tests that LES line codes are correctly normalized to canonical format.

**Results:**
- ✅ "SEA PAY" → SEA_PAY
- ✅ "CAREER SEA PAY" → SEA_PAY
- ✅ "FLIGHT PAY" → FLIGHT_PAY
- ✅ "AVIATION PAY" → FLIGHT_PAY
- ✅ "ACIP" → FLIGHT_PAY
- ✅ "SUBMARINE PAY" → SUB_PAY
- ✅ "DIVE PAY" → DIVE_PAY
- ✅ "DIVING DUTY PAY" → DIVE_PAY
- ✅ "PARACHUTE PAY" → JUMP_PAY
- ✅ "JUMP PAY" → JUMP_PAY
- ✅ "HARDSHIP" → HDP
- ✅ "HDP" → HDP

**Conclusion:** All special pay variations correctly canonicalized

---

## Test Suite 2: Hybrid Merge Logic ✅

Tests that profile fields and catalog assignments merge correctly.

**Test Scenario:**
- Profile has: SDAP ($375), FSA ($250)
- Assignments have: HDP ($100), SDAP ($450 - override)

**Results:**
- ✅ SDAP overridden to $450 (assignment wins over profile)
- ✅ FSA preserved at $250 (profile only)
- ✅ HDP added at $100 (assignment only)
- ✅ Total 3 special pays in final result

**Conclusion:** Merge precedence works correctly (assignments > profile)

---

## Test Suite 3: CZTE Detection Logic ✅

Tests Combat Zone Tax Exclusion flag generation.

**Results:**
- ✅ Deployed + Zero Fed Tax → CZTE_ACTIVE (green) ✓
- ✅ Not Deployed + Zero Fed Tax + FICA → POSSIBLE_CZTE (yellow) ✓
- ✅ Not Deployed + Normal Fed Tax → No CZTE flag ✓
- ✅ Deployed + Non-Zero Fed Tax → No CZTE flag (user error case) ✓

**Conclusion:** CZTE logic correctly handles all scenarios

---

## Test Suite 4: Flag Generation Logic ✅

Tests special pay flag creation based on expected vs actual.

**Results:**
- ✅ Expected FSA, LES has FSA → FSA_CORRECT (green)
- ✅ Expected FSA, LES missing → SPECIAL_PAY_MISSING (red)
- ✅ Not expected, LES has SDAP → SPECIAL_PAY_UNEXPECTED (yellow)
- ✅ Expected $250, LES has $240 → Correct (within $10 tolerance)

**Note:** The $10 delta is within tolerance threshold (>$10 triggers mismatch). This is correct behavior.

**Conclusion:** Flag generation logic works as designed

---

## Test Suite 5: Database Integration ✅

Tests database schema, constraints, and queries.

### Test 5.1: CZTE Column Migration
```sql
SELECT currently_deployed_czte FROM user_profiles
```
**Result:** ✅ All 4 existing profiles have `currently_deployed_czte = false` (default applied correctly)

### Test 5.2: Foreign Key Constraint
```sql
INSERT INTO user_special_pay_assignments (user_id, code) VALUES ('test', 'INVALID_CODE')
```
**Result:** ✅ Foreign key violation correctly prevented (can't insert invalid code)

### Test 5.3: Hybrid Query Simulation
```sql
SELECT code, cents FROM (profile UNION catalog) WHERE calc_method = 'flat_monthly'
```
**Result:** ✅ Returns 5 special pays: SDAP, IDP (profile) + FLPP, FSA, HDP (catalog)

**Conclusion:** Database schema and constraints working correctly

---

## Additional Validation Tests

npm run lint
```
- ⚠️  Pre-existing warnings in unrelated files (PCS, tests)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Not Issues (By Design)
1. **$10 tolerance for special pay variance:** $250 vs $240 = CORRECT (within threshold)
   - This is intentional to avoid false positives for rounding
   
2. **Rate table pays show UNEXPECTED flag:** SEA/FLIGHT/SUB/DIVE/JUMP trigger yellow
   - Deferred to v2 - this is expected behavior
   
3. **Pre-existing lint warnings:** Unrelated to LES Auditor changes
   - These existed before this implementation

### Actual Limitations (Documented in V2 Roadmap)
1. SEA/FLIGHT/SUB/DIVE/JUMP: Detection only, no validation
2. Debts & garnishments: Parse only, no tracking
3. One-time pays: Parse only, no DLA/bonus tracking
4. CZTE: Boolean only, no date tracking

## Recommended Manual Test Plan

### Test 1: Profile CZTE UI
1. Go to `/dashboard/profile/setup`
2. Scroll to Section 7
3. Verify CZTE checkbox appears
4. Check the box → Verify green confirmation shows
5. Save profile → Verify saves without error
6. Refresh page → Verify checkbox stays checked

### Test 2: CZTE Active (Green Flag)
1. Ensure CZTE checked in profile
2. Go to `/dashboard/paycheck-audit`
3. Manual entry: Base $6000, Fed Tax $0, FICA $372, Medicare $87
4. Verify: Green flag "✅ CZTE active - Zero federal tax is correct"

### Test 3: Possible CZTE (Yellow Flag)
1. Uncheck CZTE in profile
2. Manual entry: Base $6000, Fed Tax $0, FICA $372, Medicare $87
3. Verify: Yellow flag "Zero federal tax detected but CZTE flag not set"

### Test 4: Special Pay Missing (Red Flag)
1. Profile: Enable FSA ($250)
2. Manual entry: Include BAH, BAS, but OMIT FSA
3. Verify: Red flag "FSA missing: Expected $250.00/month"

### Test 5: Special Pay Unexpected (Yellow Flag)
1. Profile: No special pays enabled
2. Manual entry: Include SDAP ($375)
3. Verify: Yellow flag "SDAP found ($375.00/month) but not in your profile"

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- Hybrid merge adds 2 queries: user_profiles + user_special_pay_assignments
- Catalog lookup adds 1 query: special_pay_catalog
- **Total:** 3 queries vs 1 previously
- **Optimization:** All queries indexed, should be <50ms each

### Memory Usage
- Special pays map: ~10 entries max = negligible
- No PDF storage (parse-and-purge unchanged)
- Flag array: +0-4 new flags per audit

### API Response Time
- Expected increase: +10-30ms for hybrid merge
- Still well under 2-second target
- Cached catalog lookups in future optimization

---

## Security Verification

### RLS Policies ✅
```sql
-- user_special_pay_assignments policy verified
SELECT * FROM user_special_pay_assignments WHERE user_id = auth.uid()::text
```
✅ Users can only see their own assignments

### Data Privacy ✅
- ✅ No PII in new tables
- ✅ Special pay amounts = financial metadata (non-sensitive)
- ✅ CZTE boolean = operational status (non-sensitive)
- ✅ Parse-and-purge LES architecture unchanged

### Injection Protection ✅
- ✅ All queries use parameterized statements
- ✅ Foreign key constraints prevent invalid data
- ✅ Type validation in TypeScript
- ✅ Server-side only (no client DB access)
