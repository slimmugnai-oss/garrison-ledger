         "acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A POA is a legal document giving someone authority to make financial or legal decisions. A General POA grants broad powers, while a Special POA is limited to specific actions. Most military families need a Special POA for deployment, which your base legal office can prepare for free."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"What is OPSEC and what can I safely post online?",
         "acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"OPSEC (Operational Security) protects information that could endanger service members or missions. Never post specific dates, locations, troop movements, or mission details. Keep posts positive and general. When in doubt, don't post it."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"How can I help my children cope with the separation?",
         "acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Maintain connection and routine: be honest with age-appropriate explanations, stay connected through video calls and letters, keep normal schedules for stability, and use base resources like Fleet & Family Support Center counselors."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Why does homecoming feel so difficult when it's supposed to be happy?",
         "acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Reintegration is a process, not a single event. It's normal to feel awkward or stressful as the service member readjusts from structured environment while the at-home spouse has been managing everything solo. It takes time to relearn roles and reconnect. Be patient and communicate openly."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"How long does a typical military deployment last?",
         "acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Standard deployments typically last 6-12 months, though length varies by branch, mission, and unit. Some specialized deployments may be shorter (3-4 months) while others extend longer. Your unit will provide specific timeline information during pre-deployment briefings."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"What financial support is available during deployment?",
         "acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Service members receive special pays during deployment including Imminent Danger Pay (IDP), Hardship Duty Pay (HDP), and Family Separation Allowance (FSA). Additionally, combat zone tax exclusion (CZTE) makes deployed pay tax-free. Set up allotments before deploying to automate bill payments."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"How do I stay connected during deployment?",
         "acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Modern deployments offer multiple communication options: email, video calls (when bandwidth allows), phone calls, and traditional letters. Create a communication plan before deployment. Understand that connectivity varies by location and mission requirements. OPSEC rules always apply."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"What is a Family Readiness Group (FRG) and should I join?",
         "acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"FRGs are unit-sponsored organizations that provide support, information, and community for military families during deployment. They organize social events, share official updates, and connect families facing similar challenges. Participation is voluntary but highly recommended for first-time deployment families."}}

                <strong>Military deployment</strong> typically lasts 6-12 months. <strong>Pre-deployment preparation</strong> includes: Power of Attorney (free at base legal), financial planning with allotments, updating wills/beneficiaries, and creating communication plan. <strong>During deployment:</strong> maintain routines for children, join Family Readiness Group (FRG), use Military OneSource for free counseling. Service members receive special pays: Imminent Danger Pay (IDP), Hardship Duty Pay (HDP), Family Separation Allowance (FSA), plus combat zone tax exclusion (CZTE). <strong>Reintegration takes time</strong> - expect adjustment period of 3-6 months. Professional support available through TRICARE, chaplains, and installation counseling centers. <strong>OPSEC reminder:</strong> never post deployment dates, locations, or mission details online.

Understanding their potential challenges is key to a smoother reunion. Be prepared for sensory overload (crowds and loud noises can be overwhelming), a need for quiet time to decompress, and a period of readjustment as they find their place back in the family's daily rhythm. Patience is your most powerful tool.</p>

Your base legal office can prepare these for you for free.</p>

When in doubt, don't post it.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Reintegration is a process, not a single event. It's completely normal for it to feel awkward or stressful. The service member has been in a highly structured environment, while the at-home spouse has been managing everything solo. It takes time to relearn household roles, reconnect as a couple, and for kids to readjust. Be patient with each other and communicate openly about expectations.</p>
