## 🎯 ARCHITECTURE NOTES:

### **Parallel AI Processing:**
```
User Request → strategic-plan API
  ↓
  ├─ Rules Engine (fast, reliable baseline)
  ├─ GPT-4o Scoring (personalized block selection)
  └─ GPT-4o Roadmap (executive summary + section intros)
  ↓
Combined → Cached Plan (7-day expiry)
```

### **Profile Integration:**
- Profile data loaded from `user_profiles` table
- Merged with assessment answers
- Full context sent to GPT-4o:
  - Rank, branch, component, base, PCS timeline
  - Family structure, children, EFMP
  - Financial ranges (TSP, debt, emergency fund)
  - Career interests, financial priorities
  - Goals and preferences

### **Cache Strategy:**
- 7-day plan cache by assessment hash
- Invalidates when assessment OR profile changes
- Cache cleared for testing

---

## 🚀 WHAT'S READY FOR TESTING:

1. **Profile Setup Flow:**
   - Go to `/dashboard/profile/setup`
   - Fill out rank, branch, base, family, finances, goals
   - See data reflected in dashboard

2. **Dynamic Dashboard:**
   - Profile snapshot shows your real data
   - Timeline view calculates PCS countdown
   - Financial snapshot displays ranges
   - All widgets conditional on data

3. **AI-Enhanced Plan:**
   - Go to `/dashboard/plan`
   - See executive summary at top (personalized to YOUR profile)
   - See domain sections with custom intros
   - See "Why This Matters for You" reasoning on each block

4. **Privacy:**
   - All tracking disabled
   - Optional fields clearly marked
   - "Prefer not to say" options available

---

## 📝 KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS:

1. **Assessment is unchanged** - We upgraded the OUTPUT (plan), not the input (assessment questions)
2. **Cache** - Plans cache for 7 days. Cleared manually for testing. Need to add "Regenerate Plan" button.
3. **Domain classification** - Currently based on slug patterns (simple). Could be improved with explicit domain field.
4. **No plan regeneration button** - Users can't force-refresh their plan yet

---

## 🔜 WHAT'S NEXT (Future Sessions):

### **Phase 3 Remaining:**
- Command center redesign (if needed - dashboard is already pretty good)
- Quick actions widget (AI-suggested next steps)
- Regenerate plan button

### **Polish & Testing:**
- Test GPT-4o quality with real profile data
- Refine prompts based on actual outputs
- A/B test different temperatures/settings
- Add loading states for AI generation

### **Content Expansion (Optional):**
- Priority 1 Research: Insurance/SGLI, Tricare, GI Bill, BAH
- Target: 200+ total blocks (we're at 379, already exceeded!)

---

## 💾 DEPLOYMENT STATUS:

**All code is LIVE on production:**
- Vercel deployed automatically on push
- Database migrations already applied
- `user_profiles` table exists with 0 rows (waiting for users)
- Plan cache cleared
- All new endpoints active

---

## 🎊 BOTTOM LINE:

**You now have a premium, AI-powered, personalized military planning platform that:**
- Knows who your users are (rank, base, family, goals)
- Generates custom executive summaries
- Explains why each recommendation matters to THEM specifically
- Displays dynamic dashboards that reflect their situation
- Respects privacy with optional fields
- Has no tracking

**This is ready for real users to test and provide feedback.**
