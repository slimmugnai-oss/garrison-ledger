# CURSOR AI AGENT RULES FOR GARRISON LEDGER

## 🎯 PROJECT CONTEXT

You are working on **Garrison Ledger**, an AI-powered military financial planning platform. The core innovation is the **AI Master Curator & Narrative Weaver** system that intelligently selects 8-10 expert content blocks and generates personalized financial plans.

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL: MILITARY AUDIENCE FILTER**

**Before implementing ANY feature, content, design, or business decision, ALWAYS ask:**

1. **Does it respect military values?** (no-BS, direct, professional)
2. **Does it build trust?** (realistic guarantees, no hype)
3. **Does it serve the user?** (clarity, no tricks)
4. **Is it mature and professional?** (no childish emojis)

**If any answer is "no," DO NOT IMPLEMENT IT.** Military audience values must override generic SaaS tactics.

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

### **Core Systems (Don't Break These)**

1. **AI Master Curator System**
   - Two-phase: Curator (select blocks) → Weaver (create narrative)
   - Uses GPT-4o, costs ~$0.25/plan
   - Saves to `user_plans` table
   - DO NOT modify without discussing impact

2. **Content Intelligence**
   - 410 hand-curated content blocks
   - 100% metadata coverage required
   - Vector search infrastructure ready
   - DO NOT modify content blocks without migration

3. **Dual Assessment System**
   - Old: `assessments` table (backward compatibility)
   - New: `user_assessments` table (AI system)
   - Dashboard checks BOTH for `hasAssessment`
   - MAINTAIN both systems

---

## 💻 CODING STANDARDS

### **TypeScript**
- Use explicit types, avoid `any`
- Use TypeScript 5.x features
- Import types separately: `import type { Metadata } from 'next'`

### **React/Next.js**
- Use Server Components by default
- Client Components only when needed (`'use client'`)
- Use Next.js App Router conventions
- Prefer `Link` over `<a>` tags

### **🎨 ICON USAGE (CRITICAL)**
- **ALWAYS check `docs/ICON_USAGE_GUIDE.md` before using icons**
- **NEVER use these icons:** `Ship`, `Anchor`, `FileText`, `FileCheck`, `Clock`
- **Safe replacements:** `Shield` (military), `File` (documents), `CheckCircle` (approval), `Timer` (time)
- **Before deployment:** Run `npm run check-icons` to validate all icons
- **Use existing icons when possible** - don't add new ones unless necessary
- **All icons must be in `app/components/ui/icon-registry.ts`**

### **Database**
- Always use Supabase RLS policies
- Use `supabaseAdmin` for server-side operations
- Create migrations for schema changes
- Test migrations before applying

### **API Routes**
- Use `auth()` from Clerk for authentication
- Return proper HTTP status codes
- Use `checkAndIncrement` for rate limiting
- Handle errors gracefully

### **UI Components**
- Use existing components from `app/components/ui/`
- Follow Tailwind design system
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Use Icon component with type-safe icon names

---

## 🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM

### **Colors**
- Primary: Blue-600
- Success: Green-600
- Warning: Yellow-600
- Danger: Red-600
- Text: Gray-900 (headings), Gray-700 (body)

### **Typography**
- Headings: Lora serif font
- Body: Inter sans-serif
- Use semantic HTML (h1, h2, h3)

### **Components**
- AnimatedCard: Fade-in animation
- Badge: Status indicators
- PageHeader: Consistent page headers
- Icon: Type-safe icon wrapper

---

## 📝 DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### **When to Document**
- New features or systems
- Breaking changes
- API endpoint changes

### **Where to Document**
1. **SYSTEM_STATUS.md** - Update current state
2. **Feature-specific docs** - Create in `docs/active/`
3. **Code comments** - For complex logic
4. **Commit messages** - Use conventional commits

### **Documentation Format**
```markdown
# Feature Name

## Purpose
Why this exists

## Implementation
How it works

## Usage
How to use it

## Technical Details

4. Verify environment variables
5. Check middleware and RLS policies

### **Common Issues**
- **Auth errors**: Check Clerk configuration
- **Database errors**: Check RLS policies
- **API errors**: Check rate limiting
- **Build errors**: Check TypeScript types

---

## 📊 PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### **Database Queries**
