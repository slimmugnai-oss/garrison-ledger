## ‚úÖ WHAT TO VERIFY

### Auto-Fill Accuracy:
- [ ] BAH matches DFAS calculator for rank + location + dependents
- [ ] BAS matches official rate (officer vs enlisted)
- [ ] Base Pay matches pay table for rank + YOS
- [ ] COLA correct (most CONUS = $0, some high-cost areas have COLA)
- [ ] TSP calculated from user's % on total pay
- [ ] SGLI premium matches coverage amount

### Manual Entry Works:
- [ ] Can enter Federal tax
- [ ] Can enter State tax
- [ ] Can enter FICA
- [ ] Can enter Medicare
- [ ] Can enter Dental premium
- [ ] Can enter Net pay

### Validation Logic:
- [ ] FICA percentage validated (~6.2%)
- [ ] Medicare percentage validated (~1.45%)
- [ ] Net pay math validated (Total - Deductions - Taxes)
- [ ] Green flags for correct values
- [ ] Yellow flags for minor variances
- [ ] Red flags for major issues

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] No COLA location (should show $0, not error)
- [ ] No special pays (should skip those fields)
- [ ] No state tax (TX, FL, WA) - should accept $0
- [ ] Override auto-filled value (should work)

---

## üêõ COMMON ISSUES TO WATCH FOR

### Issue: Auto-Fill Not Working
**Cause:** Profile incomplete (missing paygrade, mha_code, or has_dependents)  
**Fix:** Complete profile setup, ensure all required fields filled

### Issue: BAH Not Found
**Cause:** Base not in base-mha-map.json or MHA code not in bah_rates table  
**Fix:** Use MHA override field in profile, or add base to mapping

### Issue: Base Pay Not Auto-Filling
**Cause:** Missing time_in_service_months in profile  
**Fix:** Add time in service to profile (computed as time_in_service_months)

### Issue: FICA Percentage Warning
**Cause:** User entered FICA that's not ~6.2% of taxable gross  
**Expected:** May be correct if user hit wage base or has deployment exemptions  
**Action:** Verify taxable gross calculation

## üêõ DEBUGGING TIPS

### If Auto-Fill Doesn't Work:

**Check 1: Profile Completeness**
```sql
SELECT paygrade, mha_code, has_dependents, time_in_service_months 
FROM user_profiles 
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
```

All fields should be populated. If any NULL ‚Üí complete profile.

**Check 2: MHA Code Lookup**
```sql
SELECT * FROM bah_rates 
WHERE mha = 'TX191' 
AND paygrade = 'E05' 
AND with_dependents = true
AND effective_date = '2025-01-01';
```

Should return 1 row with rate_cents. If empty ‚Üí MHA code wrong or not in table.

**Check 3: Base Pay Lookup**
```sql
SELECT * FROM military_pay_tables
WHERE paygrade = 'E05'
AND years_of_service <= 8
ORDER BY years_of_service DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Should return highest YOS ‚â§ 8 for E05. If empty ‚Üí pay tables not loaded.

### If Validation Fails:

**Check: Taxable Gross Calculation**
- Should be: Base Pay + COLA + Special Pays
- Should NOT include: BAH, BAS
- Example: $3,500 (base) + $0 (COLA) = $3,500 taxable

**Check: FICA Calculation**
- Should be: 6.2% of taxable gross
- Example: $3,500 √ó 0.062 = $217

**Check: Total Pay Calculation**
- Should be: Taxable Gross + BAH + BAS
- Example: $3,500 + $1,800 + $460.25 = $5,760.25 total
