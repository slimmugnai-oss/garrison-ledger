### Option 2: Supabase SQL Editor
If you prefer manual SQL execution:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql
2. Paste this SQL:

```sql
-- Clear all cached neighborhood data
DELETE FROM neighborhood_profiles WHERE created_at < NOW();
DELETE FROM base_external_data_cache WHERE created_at < NOW();

-- Verify (should show 0 or very few)
SELECT COUNT(*) as remaining FROM neighborhood_profiles;
SELECT COUNT(*) as remaining FROM base_external_data_cache;
```

3. Click "Run"
4. Verify counts show 0

## üîÑ WHEN TO CLEAR CACHE

Clear cache after:
- ‚úÖ Deploying new school counting logic
- ‚úÖ Fixing verbiage/accuracy issues
- ‚úÖ Updating intelligence algorithms
- ‚úÖ Changing data sources or APIs
- ‚úÖ Testing new features

---

## üìã VERIFICATION

After clearing cache:

1. **Hard refresh browser:** Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. **Run Base Navigator** for any base (e.g., JBLM, Pendleton)
3. **Check Schools tab:**
   - ‚úÖ No duplicate schools
   - ‚úÖ Accurate counts ("2 schools in area" matches reality)
   - ‚úÖ Perfect grammar ("1 school" not "1 schools")
4. **Check Housing tab:**
   - ‚úÖ Property cards with photos show
   - ‚úÖ Links work

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### Cache not clearing?
- Verify you're logged in
- Try incognito window
- Check Supabase connection
- Run manual SQL method

### Still seeing old data?
- Clear browser cache (full clear, not just refresh)
- Check that deployment completed (Vercel)
- Verify cache version bumped (should be v4)

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS

**School Counting:** v4 (unique schools, no duplicates)
**Cache Keys:**
- `sd:zip:v4:{zip}` - Schools data
- `gplaces:enhanced:v1:{zip}` - Amenities
- `zillow:listings:v2:{zip}:b{beds}` - Housing

**Last Major Fix:** Schools verbiage audit + unique counting (Oct 31, 2025)
