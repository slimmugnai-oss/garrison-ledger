# Commissary Savings Strategy

**BLUF:** Commissaries typically save military families 23% vs civilian grocery stores. Strategic shopping (case sales, coupons, avoiding convenience items) can push savings to 30-40%.

<Disclaimer kind="finance" />

## Average Savings

**Official DoD Data:**
- **Grocery items:** 23% average savings vs off-base
- **Case/lot sales:** Additional 15-20% on bulk items
- **Coupons:** Stack manufacturer + commissary (rare in civilian stores)

**BUT:** Savings vary by:
- Local civilian competition (Walmart, Costco nearby = smaller commissary advantage)
- What you buy (name brands vs generic)
- When you shop (case sales, special events)

## What Saves Most

**High Savings (30-50%):**
- Meat (especially beef, seafood)
- Diapers & baby formula
- Name-brand cereals
- Alcohol (vs off-base, varies by state)
- Tobacco products (if applicable)

**Moderate Savings (15-25%):**
- Canned goods
- Frozen foods
- Dairy products
- Cleaning supplies

**Low/No Savings (0-10%):**
- Fresh produce (often cheaper at farmer's markets)
- Generic brands (commissary has fewer generics)
- Specialty/organic items

## Strategic Shopping

### **1. Case/Lot Sales**

**What:** Buy full case (12-24 units) at bulk discount

**Savings:** 15-30% beyond standard commissary pricing

**Best for:**
- Non-perishables (canned goods, pasta, rice)
- Household items (paper towels, trash bags)
- Frozen meats
- Diapers

**Example:**
- Case of canned tomatoes: $18 (24 cans) = $0.75/can
- vs regular commissary: $1.20/can
- **Savings:** 37%

### **2. Coupon Stacking**

**Allowed at commissary (not at most civilian stores):**
- Manufacturer coupon (from Sunday paper or apps)
- Commissary digital coupon (from Commissary app)
- **Stack both** on same item

**Example:**
- Item: $5.00
- Manufacturer coupon: -$1.00
- Commissary coupon: -$0.50
- **Final price:** $3.50 (30% off)

### **3. Avoid Convenience Items**

**What NOT to buy at commissary:**
- Pre-cut fruit/veggies (markup 100-200%)
- Grab-and-go meals (cheaper to prep yourself)
- Single-serve snacks (buy bulk and portion)
- Out-of-season produce (expensive everywhere)

### **4. Compare to Off-Base**

**Sometimes civilian beats commissary:**
- Walmart/Costco generic brands
- Aldi (usually cheaper on basics)
- Ethnic grocery stores (spices, rice, specialty items)
- Farmer's markets (local produce)

**Strategy:** Split shopping:
- **Commissary:** Meat, diapers, name brands, case sales
- **Off-base:** Produce, generics, specialty items

## Surcharge Explained

**What is it?**
- 5% surcharge added at checkout
- Funds commissary operations (no tax dollars)
- Still cheaper than off-base even with surcharge

**Math:**
- Item costs $4.00 (already 23% below off-base)
- Surcharge: +$0.20 (5%)
- Final: $4.20
- **Still cheaper than** $5.20 off-base

## Exchange vs Commissary

| Item Type | Commissary | Exchange | Winner |
|-----------|------------|----------|--------|
| **Groceries** | Yes | Limited | Commissary |
| **Clothing** | No | Yes | Exchange |
| **Electronics** | No | Yes | Exchange |
| **Household** | Yes | Yes | Compare prices |
| **Alcohol** | Yes (varies) | Yes (varies) | Depends on state |

**Tax-Free:** Both commissary and exchange are tax-free.

- **Total:** $790/month

**Monthly Savings:** $58  
**Annual Savings:** $696

**With case sales + coupons:** Can push to $100-150/month ($1,200-1,800/year)
