# TLE/TLA - Temporary Lodging During PCS

**BLUF:** TLE (CONUS) and TLA (OCONUS) reimburse hotel costs during PCS when government/personal housing isn't available. You get 10 days standard (extendable to 60), plus per-diem for meals.

<Disclaimer kind="finance" />

## TLE vs TLA

**TLE (Temporary Lodging Expense) - CONUS:**
- Old duty station: Up to 10 days
- New duty station: Up to 10 days
- **Total possible:** 20 days per PCS

**TLA (Temporary Lodging Allowance) - OCONUS:**
- Old duty station: Up to 10 days
- New duty station: Up to 60 days
- Higher costs due to overseas housing scarcity

## How Much You Get

**Reimbursement = Lodging + M&IE (Meals)**

**Lodging:**
- Actual cost up to locality per-diem cap
- Taxes included (not subject to cap)
- Receipt required

**M&IE:**
- Full per-diem rate (no 75% reduction like regular TDY)
- No receipts required
- Based on locality rates

**Example (E-5 with spouse + 2 kids, Norfolk):**
- Lodging cap: $98/night
- M&IE: $59/day (member) + $44/day (spouse) + $29/day × 2 (kids) = $161/day
- **10 days:** ($98 + $161) × 10 = **$2,590 max reimbursement**

## Eligibility

**You qualify if:**
- ✅ On PCS orders
- ✅ Government housing not available (or not moving in immediately)
- ✅ Personal residence not available yet (house/apartment not ready)

**Documentation Required:**
- PCS orders
- Hotel receipts (itemized)
- Non-availability statement (if on-base housing full)

## Standard 10 Days vs Extended

**Standard Authorization:** 10 days (no special approval)

**Extension to 60 days (OCONUS) or 30 days (CONUS):**
- Requires commander approval
- Must show housing search efforts
- Approved for legitimate delays (housing not ready, waiting for lease)

**How to Request:**
- Route through transportation/housing office
- Provide evidence (lease start date, housing waitlist, etc.)

## What's Covered

**✅ Covered:**
- Hotel/extended stay
- Taxes and fees
- Meals (via M&IE)
- Pet fees (sometimes - check local policy)

**❌ NOT Covered:**
- Room service
- Mini-bar
- Movies/entertainment
- Parking (unless hotel requires it)
- Meals beyond M&IE allowance

## How to Claim

### **Step 1: Save ALL Receipts**
- Itemized hotel folio (must show room rate separate from taxes)
- Daily totals
- Payment confirmation

### **Step 2: Submit via DPS**
- [Defense Personal Property System](https://move.mil)
- Upload receipts
- Enter family size (affects M&IE)

### **Step 3: Finance Reviews**
- Usually 2-4 weeks for payment
- May contact you for clarification

## Pro Tips

✅ **Book extended stay hotels:** Usually cheaper than standard hotels for 10+ days  
✅ **Government rate:** Ask for government/military rate (often below per-diem cap)  
✅ **Check cap:** Know your locality cap before booking  
✅ **Itemized folio:** Request at checkout (required for reimbursement)  
✅ **Pets:** If you have pets, ask if pet fees are reimbursable (varies)  
✅ **Extended stay strategy:** Apply for extension early if housing delayed

## Lodging Over Cap

**If your hotel costs more than per-diem cap:**

**Option 1:** Pay difference out of pocket
- Hotel: $150/night
- Cap: $98/night
- **You pay:** $52/night extra

**Option 2:** Find cheaper hotel
- Look for extended stay (cheaper weekly rates)
- Government rate hotels (on-base or nearby)

**Option 3:** Request exception to policy**
- If no hotels available under cap
- Requires commander endorsement
- Not guaranteed

## Common Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: House Not Ready**
- Lease starts March 15
- You arrive March 1
- **TLE:** 14 days (March 1-14) - needs extension approval
- **After March 15:** Move into house, TLE ends

### **Scenario 2: On-Base Housing Waitlist**
- Accepted for on-base housing
- Waitlist: 45 days
- **TLE:** 10 days standard + extension request for 35 more days
- Housing office provides wait-time documentation

### **Scenario 3: Both Locations**
- Old base TLE: 5 days (moving out, hotel while house sells)
- New base TLE: 10 days (waiting for new house)
- **Total:** 15 days TLE claimed

## Tax Treatment

<Disclaimer kind="tax" compact />

**TLE/TLA Reimbursement:**
- Generally NOT taxable (it's reimbursement, not income)
- **BUT:** Amount over per-diem cap (if authorized) may be taxable
- Consult tax professional if you receive exception-to-policy

## Verify on LES

**Look for:**
- No specific TLE/TLA line on LES (separate claim system)
- Reimbursement comes as separate payment (direct deposit or check)
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks after submission

## Common Mistakes

❌ Not saving receipts (no receipt = no reimbursement)  
❌ Booking luxury hotel over cap (you pay difference)  
❌ Forgetting to claim (use it or lose it)  
❌ Missing extension deadline (stuck with 10 days when you needed 30)  
❌ Not getting non-availability letter (required for on-base housing full situations)
