# How to Use the Base Navigator

**BLUF:** The Base Navigator helps you find the best neighborhood for your family near your next duty station. It ranks areas by schools, rent vs BAH, commute time, and weather.

<Disclaimer kind="finance" />

## What is the Base Navigator?

The Base Navigator analyzes neighborhoods around military bases using four factors:

1. **Schools (40% weight):** Ratings from GreatSchools, weighted by your kids' grade levels
2. **Rent vs BAH (30% weight):** How median rent compares to your BAH allowance
3. **Commute (20% weight):** AM/PM drive time to base gate (with traffic)
4. **Weather (10% weight):** Temperature extremes, precipitation, humidity

**Result:** A "Family Fit Score" (0-100) for each ZIP code near the base.

## How to Use It

### **Step 1: Select Your Base**

Navigate to Base Guides and choose your next duty station:
- Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM)
- Naval Station Norfolk
- Fort Liberty (Fort Bragg)
- Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton
- [More bases coming soon]

### **Step 2: Set Your Filters**

**Bedrooms:**
- Select 2-5 bedrooms based on your family size

**Monthly BAH:**
- Enter your BAH rate from your LES
- Or look up your rate: [Use BAH Intel Card](/dashboard/intel/finance/bah-basics)

**Kids Grade Levels (Optional):**
- Select Elementary, Middle, and/or High School
- This weights school scores toward relevant grade levels
- If unsure, leave all selected (default)

### **Step 3: Compute Rankings**

Click **"Find Best Neighborhoods"**

The Navigator will:
- Query GreatSchools for top-rated schools
- Check Zillow for median rent and sample listings
- Calculate AM/PM commute times with traffic
- Analyze local weather patterns
- Compute Family Fit Score for each ZIP
- Rank neighborhoods best to worst

### **Step 4: Review Results**

Each neighborhood card shows:

**Family Fit Score (0-100):**
- 80-100: Excellent fit (green)
- 60-79: Good fit (blue)
- 40-59: Fair fit (yellow)
- 0-39: Poor fit (red)

**Subscores:**
- Schools: Weighted average of top-rated schools
- Rent vs BAH: How affordable vs your allowance
- Commute: AM/PM drive time to gate
- Weather: Comfort index based on temperature/precipitation

**Details:**
- Top 2 schools with ratings
- Median rent vs your BAH
- AM/PM commute times
- Weather summary
- 2-3 sample rental listings

## Interpreting Scores

### **Schools Score (40% weight)**

- **90-100:** Elite schools (9-10 ratings)
- **70-89:** Strong schools (7-8 ratings)
- **50-69:** Average schools (5-6 ratings)
- **Below 50:** Below-average schools

**Pro Tip:** If you select specific grade levels (e.g., Elementary only), the score weights elementary schools higher.

### **Rent vs BAH Score (30% weight)**

| Rent vs BAH | Score | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| Rent ≤ BAH | 100 | Perfect - pocket the difference |
| Rent 1-10% over | 80-99 | Good - slight stretch |
| Rent 11-20% over | 50-79 | Stretch - budget carefully |
| Rent 21-40% over | 30-49 | Challenging - cuts into other allowances |
| Rent >40% over | 15 | Very difficult - consider other ZIPs |

### **Commute Score (20% weight)**

| Commute Time | Score | Reality Check |
|--------------|-------|---------------|
| 0-15 min | 90-100 | Ideal - close to gate |
| 16-30 min | 75-89 | Standard military commute |
| 31-45 min | 55-74 | Manageable but adds up |
| 46-60 min | 35-54 | Long - consider gas/time cost |
| 61+ min | 0-34 | Very long - impacts QOL |

**Note:** AM/PM times differ due to traffic. Score uses average.

### **Weather Score (10% weight)**

Comfort index based on:
- Temperature extremes (hot days >90°F, cold days <32°F)
- Precipitation (rainy/snowy days)
- Humidity (very high or very low)

Lower weight (10%) because most military members adapt to local weather.

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is my favorite area ranked low?**  
A: Scores are weighted (schools 40%, rent 30%, commute 20%, weather 10%). If rent is significantly over BAH, it will lower the score even if schools are great.

**Q: Can I adjust the weights?**  
A: Not currently, but we're considering custom weights for premium users.

**Q: What if there's no data for a ZIP?**  
A: That ZIP receives a 0 score and is ranked last. Verify the ZIP code or contact support.

**Q: How often is data updated?**  
A: Schools/housing/commute: 24h cache. Weather: 7d cache. Listings refresh daily.

**Q: Does this account for on-base housing?**  
A: No - this tool focuses on off-base rentals. On-base housing has different waitlist/priority rules.

## Tips for Best Results

✅ **Enter accurate BAH:** Use your LES or [BAH Intel Card](/dashboard/intel/finance/bah-basics)  
✅ **Select kids' grades:** Improves school score relevance  
✅ **Try different bedroom counts:** Sometimes 4BR is cheaper than 3BR in an area  
✅ **Visit before committing:** Scores are estimates - always visit neighborhoods  
✅ **Check base housing office:** They may have local insights not in data

## Privacy & Data

- **Your searches:** Cached for performance, not shared
- **Watchlists:** Private, only you can see
- **No personal info to vendors:** We don't send your name/rank to GreatSchools/Zillow

## Next Steps

After finding your neighborhood:
1. Visit in person (PCS house-hunting trip)
2. Drive the commute during rush hour
3. Tour schools if applicable
4. Check online reviews (NextDoor, Facebook groups)
5. Apply for rentals early (competitive markets move fast)
