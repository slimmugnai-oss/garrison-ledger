# DITY/PPM Move Basics

**BLUF:** A Do-It-Yourself (DITY) or Personally Procured Move (PPM) lets you handle your own PCS move and pocket up to 95-100% of what the government would have paid a moving company.

<Disclaimer kind="finance" />

## What is a DITY/PPM Move?

Instead of letting the military arrange your move, YOU:
- Rent a truck (or use your own vehicle)
- Pack and load your belongings
- Drive to your new duty station
- Unload and unpack

**The payoff:** Government reimburses 95-100% of what they would have paid a professional mover. If you move efficiently, you **profit**.

## Reimbursement Structure

### Mileage

<RateBadge source="MILEAGE_RATE" label="2025 Official Mileage Rate" />

<AsOf source="MILEAGE_RATE" inline />

### Weight Allowance

Government reimburses based on:
- **Weight moved:** Weigh your vehicle empty, then loaded (get official weight tickets)
- **Distance:** Official mileage per DTMO
- **Allowance:** Your authorized weight allowance (based on rank and dependents)

### Example Calculation (E-6 moving 5,000 lbs, 1,000 miles)

- Mileage: 1,000 miles √ó <DataRef source="MILEAGE_RATE" showProvenance /> = $700
- Weight reimbursement: ~$2,000-$3,000 (varies by route)
- **Total reimbursement: ~$2,700-$3,700**

If your costs (truck rental, gas, tolls) = $1,800:  
**Profit: $900-$1,900** üí∞

## Steps to Execute

1. **Apply** via [DPS (Defense Personal Property System)](https://move.mil) - Select "PPM"
2. **Get counseling** from transportation office (required)
3. **Get weight tickets** (empty weight before loading, full weight after)
4. **Keep ALL receipts** (truck rental, gas, tolls, packing materials, storage)
5. **Move** to new duty station
6. **Submit claim** via DPS within 45 days of arrival

## Required Documentation

- ‚úÖ **Empty weight ticket** (truck + trailer before loading)
- ‚úÖ **Full weight ticket** (truck + trailer after loading)
- ‚úÖ **Receipts** (rental truck, gas, tolls, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Orders** (PCS orders showing authorized weight)
- ‚úÖ **Certified weight tickets** (from certified scale - CAT scales, truck stops)

## Pro Tips

‚úÖ **Weigh strategically:** Full tank of gas both times for accuracy  
‚úÖ **Use a CAT scale:** Most truck stops have them ($12-15)  
‚úÖ **Keep duplicates:** Scan all weight tickets immediately  
‚úÖ **Track expenses:** Every gas receipt, toll, rental fee  
‚úÖ **Start early:** Book truck ASAP (summer PCS season = limited availability)

## Common Pitfalls

‚ùå **Forgetting weight tickets** (no proof = no reimbursement)  
‚ùå **Exceeding weight allowance** (you pay for overage)  
‚ùå **Missing deadline** (45-day claim deadline is firm)  
‚ùå **Losing receipts** (lower reimbursement without proof)

## DITY vs Full PPM

- **Partial DITY:** Government ships some, you move some
- **Full PPM:** You move 100% of your weight allowance

Most profitable: **Full PPM** if you can handle the logistics.

## Tax Implications

<Disclaimer kind="tax" compact />

- **Reimbursements:** Generally NOT taxable (it's reimbursement, not income)
- **Profit:** Any amount you pocket is considered a reimbursement, not income
- **BUT:** Consult a tax professional if you profit significantly (some states may tax differently)
