# TSP Contribution Basics

**BLUF:** The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is your federal 401(k) with rock-bottom fees (0.042%). Max out the BRS 5% match first, then increase contributions toward the annual IRS limit.

## 2025 Contribution Limits

<RateBadge source="IRS_TSP_LIMITS" field="TSP_ELECTIVE_DEFERRAL_LIMIT_2025" label="2025 TSP Contribution Limit" />

<RateBadge source="IRS_TSP_LIMITS" field="TSP_CATCH_UP_LIMIT_2025" label="Catch-Up (Age 50+)" />

<AsOf source="IRS_TSP_LIMITS" />

These limits apply to **combined** traditional and Roth TSP contributions.

## BRS Matching (Get Free Money)

Under the Blended Retirement System (BRS):
- DoD **automatically contributes 1%** of base pay (no action needed)
- DoD **matches dollar-for-dollar up to 4%** more
- **Total possible match: 5%** of base pay

### Example Calculation

If monthly base pay = $3,500:
- Automatic 1% = $35
- **You contribute 5%** = $175
- **DoD matches 4%** = $140
- **Total monthly TSP: $350** ($175 yours + $175 DoD)

**Annual total: $4,200** ($2,100 yours + $2,100 match)

## Traditional vs Roth TSP

| Traditional TSP | Roth TSP |
|----------------|----------|
| Pre-tax contributions | After-tax contributions |
| Reduces taxable income now | No immediate tax benefit |
| Pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement | Tax-free withdrawals in retirement |
| Good if you expect lower tax bracket in retirement | Good if you expect higher tax bracket in retirement |

## Action Steps

1. **Log in to [myPay](https://mypay.dfas.mil)** to set contribution percentage
2. **Minimum:** Contribute 5% to get full DoD match
3. **Optimal:** Increase by 1% each pay raise until maxing out
4. **Fund selection:** Research C/S/I funds or use Lifecycle fund

## TSP Fund Options

- **G Fund:** Government securities (stable, low return)
- **F Fund:** Bonds (fixed income)
- **C Fund:** S&P 500 index (large US companies)
- **S Fund:** Small/mid US companies (higher risk/return)
- **I Fund:** International stocks
- **L Funds:** Lifecycle funds (auto-adjust by target retirement date)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Contributing 0% (losing free match money)  
❌ Not increasing % after promotions/raises  
❌ Forgetting to update after PCS (TSP continues automatically)  
❌ Withdrawing early (10% penalty + taxes)

## When You Separate/Retire

TSP stays with you - you can:
- **Leave it in TSP** (lowest fees in the industry)
- **Roll over to IRA** (more investment options)
- **Withdraw** (follow IRS rules to avoid penalties)

## Verify Your Contributions

Check your LES:
- **TSP TRAD** - Traditional TSP contribution
- **TSP ROTH** - Roth TSP contribution
- **TSP MATCH** - DoD matching contribution (if BRS)

Total should match your elected percentage.
