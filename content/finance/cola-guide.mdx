# Cost of Living Allowance (COLA)

**BLUF:** COLA compensates for higher living costs in certain high-cost areas. Not all locations qualify - COLA is only authorized for specific CONUS and OCONUS duty stations.

<Disclaimer kind="finance" />

## CONUS COLA (Continental US)

Only authorized for high-cost areas where the cost of living significantly exceeds the national average.

### Example Rates (2025)

<RateBadge source="COLA" code="CA917" paygrade="E06" withDeps={true} type="conus" label="E-6 with dependents, San Diego" />

<AsOf source="COLA" />

### CONUS COLA Locations (Examples)
- California: San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, San Diego
- New York: New York City metro
- Hawaii: Oahu (may receive OCONUS COLA depending on assignment)

**Note:** Most CONUS locations do NOT receive COLA.

## OCONUS COLA (Overseas)

OCONUS COLA applies to overseas locations and compensates for exchange rates and cost differences.

### Example Rates (2025)

<RateBadge source="COLA" code="JAPAN_YOKOSUKA" paygrade="E06" withDeps={true} type="oconus" label="E-6 with dependents, Yokosuka, Japan" />

### How OCONUS COLA Works
- **Surveys:** Based on actual living cost surveys
- **Index:** Percentage above/below baseline
- **Updates:** Quarterly adjustments (changes every 3 months)
- **Receipt-based:** Some locations require receipts for variable components

## COLA vs BAH

| Feature | BAH | COLA |
|---------|-----|------|
| **Purpose** | Housing costs | Non-housing cost of living |
| **Locations** | All duty stations | High-cost areas only |
| **Taxable** | Tax-free | Tax-free |
| **Updates** | Annually (January) | CONUS: annually, OCONUS: quarterly |

## Eligibility Requirements

To receive COLA, you must:
- Be stationed in a designated COLA area
- Be on permanent duty (not TDY)
- Have proper orders authorizing COLA

## When COLA Stops

COLA stops when you:
- PCS to a non-COLA location
- Go on TDY longer than 30 days
- Deploy (may receive different allowances)
- Separate from service

## Verify Your COLA

Check your LES for:
- **COLA** line under Entitlements
- **Amount** should match official rates for your location/grade/dependents

**Red flag:** If you're in a COLA area but not receiving it, contact finance ASAP.

Use [LES Auditor](/dashboard/paycheck-audit) to automatically check for COLA discrepancies.

## Special Cases

### Married to Another Service Member
- Only one member receives "with dependents" rate
- Couples negotiate who claims (usually higher rank gets "with deps")

### PCS In-Processing
- COLA typically starts on your report date
- May require additional documentation (marriage certificate, etc.)
