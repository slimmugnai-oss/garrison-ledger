# Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS)

**BLUF:** BAS is a monthly tax-free food allowance. All active duty service members receive BAS, regardless of whether they eat at the dining facility or not.

## 2025 BAS Rates

<RateBadge source="BAS" paygrade="E05" label="Enlisted BAS (all grades)" />

<RateBadge source="BAS" paygrade="O03" label="Officer BAS (all grades)" />

<AsOf source="BAS" />

## Key Facts

- **Flat rate:** Unlike BAH, BAS is the same for all enlisted members and all officers (doesn't vary by grade within category)
- **Tax-free:** BAS is not subject to federal or state income tax
- **Not negotiable:** You receive BAS whether you use the dining facility or not
- **Automatic:** Starts when you begin active duty, stops when you separate

## Who Gets BAS?

✅ **All active duty members**  
✅ **Enlisted and officers** (different rates)  
✅ **Regardless of living situation** (on-base or off-base)

❌ **Not for:** Basic trainees during initial entry training (they eat at DFAC)

## BAS vs Meal Deductions

If you're **required** to eat at the dining facility (like during certain schools or deployments), you may see:
- **BAS RCVD:** The monthly allowance you receive
- **MEAL DED:** Deduction for meals provided

This offsets the cost of provided meals.

## Common Scenario (E-5 example)

Monthly BAS: <DataRef source="BAS" paygrade="E05" />

If you:
- **Live off-base:** Keep full BAS, buy your own food
- **Eat at DFAC:** Pay per meal (~$3-5), still keep BAS
- **Deployed:** May see meal deductions if meals provided

## Verify on LES

Check your Leave and Earnings Statement:
- **Line:** "BAS" under Entitlements
- **Amount:** Should match <DataRef source="BAS" paygrade="E05" /> (enlisted) or <DataRef source="BAS" paygrade="O01" /> (officer)

Use [LES Auditor](/dashboard/paycheck-audit) to automatically verify your BAS is correct.

## When BAS Changes

BAS rates typically increase annually (usually January) to reflect food cost inflation. Updates are announced by DFAS.
