# SGLI - Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance

**BLUF:** SGLI provides up to $500,000 of low-cost life insurance for active duty service members. At $0.07 per $1,000 of coverage, it's the cheapest life insurance available. Max it out while you can.

<Disclaimer kind="finance" />

## What is SGLI?

**Coverage:**
- **Maximum:** $500,000
- **Minimum:** $50,000 (in $50,000 increments)
- **Cost:** $0.07 per $1,000/month
- **Eligibility:** Automatic for active duty

**Full coverage cost:** $500,000 × $0.07/1000 = **$35/month** (deducted from pay)

**That's ~$0.024 per day for $500,000 coverage** - absurdly cheap.

## Who's Covered

**Automatic Coverage:**
- ✅ Active duty (all branches)
- ✅ Reservists on active duty
- ✅ Cadets/midshipmen
- ✅ Ready Reserve members

**You are automatically enrolled at $500,000** unless you decline or reduce.

## Coverage Amount Options

**You can select (in $50,000 increments):**
- $50,000 ($3.50/month)
- $100,000 ($7/month)
- $150,000 ($10.50/month)
- ...up to...
- **$500,000 ($35/month)** ← Recommended

**Most service members:** Keep maximum ($500,000)

## How Much Insurance Do You Need?

**Rule of Thumb:** 10× annual income

**Example (E-5):**
- Annual income: ~$50,000 (base pay + allowances)
- Recommended coverage: $500,000
- **SGLI:** $500,000 = ✅ Perfectly aligned

**Plus:** SGLI is significantly cheaper than civilian term life for same coverage.

## Beneficiaries

**Update via milConnect or SGLV 8286:**
- Primary beneficiary (usually spouse)
- Contingent beneficiaries (children, parents)
- **Update after:** Marriage, birth, divorce, death

**⚠️ Critical:** Keep beneficiaries updated. Default = legal next of kin (may not be who you want).

## SGLI vs Civilian Life Insurance

| Feature | SGLI | Civilian Term Life |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| **Cost (30yo, $500K)** | $35/month | $50-150/month |
| **Medical Exam** | Not required | Usually required |
| **Deployment Coverage** | Yes (full coverage) | Often excluded or expensive |
| **Guaranteed Issue** | Yes (automatic) | No (can be denied) |
| **Portability** | Converts to VGLI | Portable (if you pay) |

**Verdict:** SGLI is **significantly better value** while on active duty.

## What Happens When You Separate?

**SGLI ends 120 days** after separation.

**Options:**

### **Option 1: Convert to VGLI (Veterans' Group Life Insurance)**
- Coverage: Up to $500,000 (same as SGLI)
- Cost: Age-based (increases every 5 years)
- **Age 30:** ~$45/month for $500,000
- **Age 40:** ~$75/month
- **Age 50:** ~$130/month
- **No medical exam** if you apply within 240 days of separation

### **Option 2: Buy Civilian Policy**
- Shop for term life insurance
- **Pros:** May be cheaper if young and healthy
- **Cons:** Requires medical exam, can be denied

### **Option 3: Decline (Not Recommended)**
- Only if you have sufficient coverage elsewhere
- Spouse/dependents may be unprotected

## TSGLI (Traumatic Injury)**

**Included automatically** with SGLI:
- **Cost:** $1/month (flat fee)
- **Coverage:** $25,000 to $100,000 for traumatic injuries
- **Triggers:** Loss of limb, sight, speech, severe burns

**Examples:**
- Loss of hand: $50,000-100,000 (depending on dominance)
- Severe burns (3rd degree >30% body): $100,000
- Loss of sight (one eye): $50,000

## Family SGLI (FSGLI)

**Coverage for Spouse:**
- **Maximum:** $100,000
- **Cost:** Age-based (~$5-20/month depending on spouse age)
- **Automatic:** For spouse of SGLI-insured member

**Coverage for Children:**
- **Amount:** $10,000 per child
- **Cost:** FREE

## Verify Your SGLI

**Check your LES:**
- **SGLI:** Should show deduction of $35/month (if $500K coverage)
- **TSGLI:** Should show $1/month

**If missing:** Contact IPAC/finance immediately (you may be uninsured).

Use [LES Auditor](/dashboard/paycheck-audit) to verify SGLI deductions.

## When to Decline SGLI

**Rare situations:**
- You have $1M+ civilian life insurance already
- No dependents and sufficient assets to cover final expenses
- Religious objections to insurance

**Otherwise:** Keep it. $35/month is trivial for $500,000 coverage.
