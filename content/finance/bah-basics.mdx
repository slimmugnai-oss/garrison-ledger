# Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)

**BLUF:** BAH is a monthly tax-free housing allowance based on your paygrade, zip code, and dependency status. It's designed to cover average housing costs in your duty location.

## What is BAH?

BAH rates vary by:
- **Paygrade** (E-1 through O-10)
- **Location** (Military Housing Area or ZIP code)
- **Dependency status** (with or without dependents)

Rates are updated annually, usually in January, based on local rental market data.

## Example Rates (2025)

## Who Gets BAH?

- Service members not living in government quarters
- Service members authorized to live off-base
- Applies to active duty, drilling reservists (during active duty periods)

## BAH vs OHA

- **BAH:** Continental US and some OCONUS (like Hawaii, Alaska)
- **OHA:** Overseas Housing Allowance for foreign countries (Germany, Japan, Korea)

OHA covers actual rent + utilities (receipt-based), while BAH is a fixed monthly amount.

## Common Questions

**Q: Does my spouse's income affect BAH?**  
A: No - BAH is based solely on your paygrade, location, and dependents (spouse counts as dependent).

**Q: What if my rent is higher than BAH?**  
A: BAH is a fixed entitlement, not a reimbursement. If rent exceeds BAH, you pay the difference out-of-pocket.

**Q: Can I pocket extra BAH?**  
A: Yes - if your rent is lower than BAH, you keep the difference tax-free.

**Q: What happens during PCS?**  
A: BAH switches to your new location's rate on your report date. TLE/TLA may cover the gap.

## Verify Your Rate

Check your LES (Leave and Earnings Statement) for:
- **BAH TYPE:** Should match your dependency status
- **AMOUNT:** Compare against official DFAS tables
- **START DATE:** Should align with PCS or status change
