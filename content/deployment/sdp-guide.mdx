# Savings Deposit Program (SDP)

**BLUF:** SDP offers 10% annual interest on deployment savings (up to $10,000). This is the highest guaranteed return available to service members. Enroll early in deployment to maximize interest.

<Disclaimer kind="finance" />

## What is SDP?

The Savings Deposit Program (SDP) allows deployed service members to save money at **10% annual interest**, compounded quarterly.

**Key Facts:**
- **Interest Rate:** 10% per year (fixed)
- **Maximum Deposit:** $10,000
- **Eligibility:** Must be receiving Hostile Fire Pay (HFP) or Imminent Danger Pay (IDP)
- **Duration:** Deposits allowed while deployed, interest accrues for up to 90 days after return
- **Withdrawals:** Anytime (but stops interest accrual)

## Eligibility

You qualify for SDP if:
- ✅ Deployed to designated combat zone
- ✅ Receiving HFP ($225/mo) or IDP ($150-225/mo)
- ✅ On active duty (any branch)

**Common Deployments:**
- Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria (combat zones)
- Kuwait, Qatar (IDP zones)
- Ship deployments in designated waters

## How to Enroll

### **Step 1: Start Contributing**
- **Via myPay:** Set up allotment to SDP account
- **Via Finance:** Visit in-theater finance office
- **Amount:** Any amount per month (up to $10,000 total)

### **Step 2: Monitor Balance**
- Check via myPay → "SDP Balance"
- Quarterly statements
- Interest accrues automatically

### **Step 3: Max Out Early**
**Pro Strategy:** Deposit $10,000 ASAP to maximize interest days.

**Example:**
- Deploy for 12 months
- Month 1: Deposit $10,000 (lump sum)
- Month 12: Balance = $11,000 ($1,000 interest earned)
- Month 15 (90 days post-return): Final balance = $11,250

**vs Late Deposit:**
- Month 10: Deposit $10,000
- Month 12: Only 2 months interest = $166
- Lost opportunity: $834

## Tax Implications

<Disclaimer kind="tax" compact />

**Is SDP Interest Taxable?**
- ✅ **YES** - Interest is taxable income
- ✅ Report on Form 1040 (interest income)
- ✅ You'll receive Form 1099-INT

**BUT:** Interest earned while in combat zone may be tax-exempt if your pay is under combat zone tax exclusion (CZTE) limits.

## Withdrawal Strategy

**Option 1: Leave it (90 days post-deployment)**
- Interest accrues for 90 days after HFP/IDP stops
- Maximizes total interest
- Auto-pays out after 90 days

**Option 2: Withdraw Early**
- Allowed anytime
- Interest stops immediately
- Use for emergency or other investment

**Option 3: Partial Withdrawal**
- Withdraw some, leave rest earning
- Flexibility for unexpected expenses

## SDP vs TSP

| Feature | SDP | TSP |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Return** | 10% guaranteed | Variable (market-based) |
| **Risk** | Zero | Market risk |
| **Max** | $10,000 | $23,500+ per year |
| **Duration** | Deployment + 90 days | Lifelong |
| **Liquidity** | Withdraw anytime | Age 59.5 (penalty before) |

**Strategy:** **Max SDP first** (guaranteed 10%), then TSP (long-term growth).

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I contribute more than $10,000?**  
A: No - $10,000 is the lifetime max per deployment. Additional deposits rejected.

**Q: What if I deploy multiple times?**  
A: Each deployment resets - you can deposit $10,000 per deployment.

**Q: Can my spouse open SDP?**  
A: Only if they're also deployed and receiving HFP/IDP (dual-military).

**Q: What happens if I redeploy before withdrawal?**  
A: Balance carries over, interest continues (still capped at $10,000 max balance).

**Q: Is SDP FDIC insured?**  
A: Not FDIC - it's a DoD program. But risk is zero (backed by US government).

## Pro Tips

✅ **Enroll Month 1:** Don't wait - every month counts  
✅ **Lump Sum:** If possible, deposit $10,000 immediately  
✅ **Check myPay:** Verify deposits are processing  
✅ **Plan for taxes:** Set aside ~25% of interest for April 15  
✅ **Combine with CZTE:** If below threshold, interest may be tax-free

## Common Mistakes

❌ Waiting until mid-deployment (loses months of interest)  
❌ Not checking balance (deposits can fail)  
❌ Forgetting to withdraw (auto-pays after 90 days, but good to verify)  
❌ Not saving for taxes (interest is taxable)
