# Combat Pay & Combat Zone Tax Exclusion

**BLUF:** Deployed service members in combat zones receive tax-free income (CZTE) plus Hostile Fire Pay (HFP) or Imminent Danger Pay (IDP). This significantly reduces your tax burden and creates unique financial planning opportunities.

<Disclaimer kind="tax" />

## Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE)

**What is it?**
Income earned while deployed to a designated combat zone is **excluded from federal income tax**.

**What's Tax-Free:**
- Base pay
- Special pays (HFP, IDP, etc.)
- Bonuses earned during deployment
- **Limit:** Enlisted = ALL income tax-free. Officers = up to max enlisted pay (~$9,500/month as of 2025)

**What's NOT Tax-Free:**
- BAH, BAS (already tax-free)
- Income earned before/after deployment
- Non-combat zone income

## Hostile Fire Pay (HFP) vs Imminent Danger Pay (IDP)

| Feature | HFP | IDP |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Amount** | $225/month | $150-225/month |
| **Trigger** | Hostile fire or hostile action | Designated IDP location |
| **Proration** | 1 day = full month | Monthly rate |
| **Tax Status** | Tax-free (CZTE) | Tax-free (CZTE) |

**Examples:**
- Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria → HFP ($225)
- Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan → IDP ($225)
- Ship in Persian Gulf → HFP/IDP (depends on location)

## Financial Planning Opportunities

### **1. Maximize TSP Contributions**

Combat zone income is tax-free **BUT** TSP contributions from combat pay are **NOT tax-deductible** (you already got the tax break).

**Strategy:**
- Contribute to **Roth TSP** from combat pay (tax-free in, tax-free out)
- Don't waste traditional TSP deduction (no tax benefit in combat zone)
- Max out Roth while deployed ($23,500/year limit)

### **2. SDP (10% Interest)**

Enroll in Savings Deposit Program:
- Deposit up to $10,000
- Earn 10% annual interest
- See [SDP Guide](/dashboard/intel/deployment/sdp-guide)

### **3. Pay Down Debt**

Tax-free income = more money to attack high-interest debt:
- Credit cards (18-25% APR) → Pay off aggressively
- Car loans → Extra payments
- Student loans → Lump sum payments

### **4. Emergency Fund**

Build 6-month emergency fund with tax-free income:
- No taxes = faster accumulation
- Deployment income often higher (no meal costs, etc.)

## How CZTE Appears on LES

**Look for:**
- **CZTE** line under entitlements
- **HFP** or **IDP** line ($225 or $150)
- **Base pay** should show in "tax-free" column

**Verify with:**
- W-2 Box 12 Code Q (shows tax-free combat pay)
- Annual LES summary

Use [LES Auditor](/dashboard/paycheck-audit) to verify your HFP/IDP is correct.

## Tax Filing

<Disclaimer kind="tax" />

**W-2 Treatment:**
- Box 1 (Wages): **Excludes** combat zone pay
- Box 12 Code Q: **Shows** combat zone pay (informational)
- **Result:** Lower AGI = lower taxes, potential credits

**Impact:**
- Lower tax bracket
- May qualify for EITC (Earned Income Tax Credit)
- May qualify for child tax credit
- **BUT:** Lower AGI may affect some income-based programs

## State Taxes

**Most states:** Exempt combat pay from state income tax

**Exceptions:** Check your state's rules (some don't follow federal CZTE)

**Military Spouse Tax Relief:**
- Spouse can claim your state of residence
- May avoid high-tax states during PCS

## Common Questions

**Q: Is all deployment income tax-free?**  
A: Only if deployed to **designated combat zone**. Training in Germany = taxable.

**Q: Do officers get full CZTE?**  
A: No - capped at max enlisted pay (~$9,500/mo). Excess is taxable.

**Q: Can I still contribute to traditional TSP?**  
A: Yes, but there's no tax benefit (use Roth instead).

**Q: Does CZTE affect BAH/BAS?**  
A: No - BAH/BAS are always tax-free regardless of location.

**Q: What if I deploy mid-month?**  
A: HFP/IDP is prorated by day. CZTE starts day you enter combat zone.
