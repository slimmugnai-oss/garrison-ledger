# Tuition Assistance (TA)

**BLUF:** Tuition Assistance (TA) covers up to $4,500 per year (or $250 per credit hour) for active duty service members pursuing college degrees. TA pays upfront - you don't need to wait until after graduation like GI Bill.

<Disclaimer kind="benefits" />

## What is Tuition Assistance?

**TA Covers:**
- Undergraduate courses
- Graduate courses
- Vocational/technical training (some programs)
- Online or in-person classes

**Annual Limits (FY 2025):**
- **Per year:** $4,500
- **Per credit hour:** $250
- **Typical semester:** 12 credits × $250 = $3,000

**Not Covered:**
- Books & materials
- Lab fees
- Technology fees
- Parking
- Application fees

## Eligibility

**Active Duty:** ✅ All branches  
**Guard/Reserve:** ⚠️ Varies by state/component  
**Service Commitment:** Usually 2+ years remaining  
**Grade Requirement:** Usually E-2 or above (varies by branch)

## How TA Works

### **Step 1: Get Approved**
- Submit TA request via your service's portal:
  - **Army:** ArmyIgnitED
  - **Navy:** Navy TA (via FLTMPS)
  - **Air Force:** Air Force Virtual Education Center
  - **Marine Corps:** MarineNet
  - **Space Force:** Space Force TA

### **Step 2: Enroll in Course**
- Choose approved institution (most regionally accredited schools qualify)
- Enroll in course
- Upload proof of enrollment

### **Step 3: TA Pays School**
- DoD pays school directly (not you)
- Happens before semester starts
- You owe $0 upfront

### **Step 4: Pass the Course**
- **Minimum grade:** Usually C or higher
- **If you fail:** Must repay TA for that course
- **Withdrawal:** Repayment required if after drop/add period

## TA vs GI Bill

| Feature | Tuition Assistance (TA) | GI Bill |
|---------|------------------------|---------|
| **When** | While on active duty | After service (usually) |
| **Annual limit** | $4,500 | ~$27,000+ per year |
| **Who pays** | DoD → School | VA → You (BAH included) |
| **Service requirement** | Active duty | Completed service + eligibility |
| **Books** | Not covered | Monthly stipend |
| **Housing** | Not covered | Monthly BAH (Post-9/11) |
| **Best for** | Slow & steady (1-2 classes/semester) | Full-time student post-service |

**Strategy:** Use TA while active, save GI Bill for post-service or transfer to dependents.

## Repayment Obligations

**You must repay TA if:**
- ❌ Fail the course (grade below C)
- ❌ Withdraw after drop/add deadline
- ❌ Separate before course completion (discharge, separation)
- ❌ Receive non-punitive disciplinary action during course

**Repayment Method:**
- Usually deducted from paycheck
- Can request installment plan
- Must repay before separation

## Pro Tips

✅ **Start slow:** 1-2 courses per semester while learning the balance  
✅ **Use TA first:** Save GI Bill for post-service or family transfer  
✅ **Pick accredited schools:** Avoid degree mills (waste of TA)  
✅ **Plan around deployments:** Don't enroll if deploying mid-semester  
✅ **Keep receipts:** For books (tax deduction possible)  
✅ **Check MilTA:** Military Tuition Assistance portal for approved schools

## Common Mistakes

❌ Enrolling in too many courses (fail risk = repayment)  
❌ Using GI Bill instead of TA while active (wastes TA benefit)  
❌ Choosing expensive schools (TA caps at $250/credit - you pay overage)  
❌ Forgetting to submit TA paperwork (miss deadline = pay out of pocket)
