# GI Bill Transfer to Dependents

**BLUF:** Service members with 6+ years can transfer Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to spouse or children. This requires a 4-year service commitment and must be approved while on active duty.

<Disclaimer kind="benefits" />

## Transfer Eligibility

**Requirements:**
- ✅ **6 years** of service completed
- ✅ **4 years** remaining commitment (or agree to extend)
- ✅ **On active duty** when approved (can't transfer after separation)
- ✅ **Eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill** (usually 90+ days active duty post-9/11)

**Who Can Receive:**
- ✅ Spouse (any amount up to 36 months)
- ✅ Children (divide 36 months among multiple kids)
- ⚠️ Must be in DEERS

## How Much Can You Transfer?

**Total Available:** 36 months of benefits (Post-9/11 GI Bill)

**Allocation Examples:**
- **Option 1:** All 36 months to spouse
- **Option 2:** 18 months to spouse, 18 to one child
- **Option 3:** 12 months each to 3 children
- **Option 4:** Keep some for yourself, transfer rest

**You can change allocation** while on active duty.

## How to Transfer

### **Step 1: Apply via milConnect**
- Go to: [milConnect](https://milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil)
- Click "Transfer of Education Benefits"
- Select recipients (spouse and/or children)
- Allocate months to each

### **Step 2: Wait for Approval**
- Processing time: 30-60 days
- Service approves based on your remaining commitment
- You'll get confirmation via milConnect

### **Step 3: Recipients Use Benefits**
- Spouse: Can use immediately (if approved)
- Children: Can use after high school graduation or age 18
- Must be used within 15 years of your separation (spouse has no time limit while married)

## Service Commitment

**Critical:** Transfer requires **4 additional years of service**.

**Example:**
- You have 8 years of service
- You transfer GI Bill → Commit to 12 total years
- If you separate before 12 years, transfer may be revoked

**Exceptions:**
- Medical retirement (transfer usually preserved)
- RIF (reduction in force) - case-by-case
- Retirement-eligible (20+ years) - may not need additional commitment

## When Recipients Can Use

**Spouse:**
- Immediately after transfer approved
- No time limit while married to you
- 15 years after your separation if divorced

**Children:**
- After high school graduation OR age 18
- Must use before age 26
- College, vocational school, apprenticeships

## What GI Bill Covers

**Post-9/11 GI Bill Benefits:**
- **Tuition:** 100% at public schools (in-state), or up to ~$28,000/year at private schools
- **BAH:** Monthly housing allowance (E-5 with dependents rate)
- **Books:** $1,000/year stipend
- **Yellow Ribbon:** May cover tuition gap at private schools

**Note:** Recipient gets these benefits, not you (once transferred).

## TA vs GI Bill (For YOU)

**While Active Duty:**
- Use **Tuition Assistance** ($4,500/year, no commitment)
- Save **GI Bill** for post-service or family

**Why:**
- TA is free money (no additional service required)
- GI Bill is more valuable post-service (includes BAH)
- Can transfer GI Bill unused months to family

## Transfer vs Keep

**Transfer to Family IF:**
- ✅ You plan to stay in 4+ more years anyway
- ✅ Spouse/kids will use it
- ✅ You can use TA for your own education
- ✅ Family education is priority

**Keep for Yourself IF:**
- ✅ Planning to separate soon
- ✅ Want MBA or grad school post-service
- ✅ Unsure about family's college plans
- ✅ Don't want 4-year commitment

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I transfer AFTER I separate?**  
A: No - must be approved while on active duty.

**Q: Can I take back transferred benefits?**  
A: Yes, while on active duty. After separation, no.

**Q: What if my spouse/kid doesn't use it?**  
A: It's "lost" - you can't reclaim after separation.

**Q: Can I transfer to stepchildren?**  
A: Yes, if they're in DEERS as your dependents.

**Q: Does transfer affect MY education?**  
A: You can use TA ($4,500/year) while active, so usually no impact.

**Q: What if I get medically retired before 4 years?**  
A: Transfer typically preserved if retirement is service-connected.

## Pro Tips

✅ **Apply early:** While you have 4+ years left (don't wait until last minute)  
✅ **Over-allocate initially:** Can reduce later, but can't increase after separation  
✅ **Verify DEERS:** Ensure spouse/kids are in system  
✅ **Document approval:** Save confirmation email  
✅ **Plan spouse career:** GI Bill BAH can replace lost income during school

## Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Waiting until last year of service (may not have 4 years to commit)  
❌ Transferring without discussing with family (they may not use it)  
❌ Forgetting to update after divorce/remarriage  
❌ Not using TA for yourself (free benefit while active)
