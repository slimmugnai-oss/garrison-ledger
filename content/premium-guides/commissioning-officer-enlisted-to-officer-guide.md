## Common Questions

### Q: Can I commission if I have a general discharge?
**A:** No. Must have honorable discharge or be in good standing if transitioning.

### Q: Will my enlisted time count toward officer retirement?
**A:** Yes! All active duty time counts. If you have 10 years enlisted + 10 years officer = 20 years total retirement.

### Q: Can I go back to enlisted if I don't like being an officer?
**A:** Extremely rare. Once commissioned, you're an officer. Resigning commission is possible but uncommon.

### Q: Do I lose my rank when I go to OCS?
**A:** Yes, temporarily. At OCS you're a "candidate" (no rank). Upon commissioning, you become O-1.

### Q: Will I outrank my former NCOs?
**A:** Yes. As an O-1, you outrank all enlisted (including E-9s). But respect and professionalism matter more than rank.

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Waiting Too Long to Apply
**Reality:** Age limits are strict. If you're 32 and want to commission by 35, you need to apply NOW.

**Fix:** Apply as soon as you have bachelor's degree (or are close to finishing).

### ❌ Mistake #2: Poor Officer Interview Prep
**Reality:** You show up unprepared. Board asks, "Why do you want to be an officer?" You say, "More money." Rejected.

**Fix:** Prepare thoughtful answers. Focus on leadership, service, mission.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Thinking Degree = Automatic Commission
**Reality:** Bachelor's degree is MINIMUM requirement. Still need competitive scores, PT, interview.

**Fix:** Treat OCS application like job application. Sell yourself.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Choosing Wrong Commissioning Path
**Reality:** You pick Green-to-Gold Active Duty (must finish in 24 months) but your degree will take 3 years. Disqualified.

**Fix:** Research each path. Pick one that matches your timeline and situation.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Using TA/GI Bill for Degree First
**Reality:** You pay out-of-pocket for degree, then commission. You wasted TA/GI Bill.

**Fix:** Use Tuition Assistance (TA) while enlisted. Save GI Bill for master's degree as an officer.
