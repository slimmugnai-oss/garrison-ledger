# School Transfers During PCS: Complete Guide for Military Kids

**Bottom Line Up Front:** PCS disrupts kids' education - plan 6+ months ahead. DoDEA schools (on-base) have no tuition but waitlists. Public schools vary by state (some excellent, some poor). Private/international schools cost $10,000-$30,000/year (not reimbursed). Get transcripts, IEPs, and records BEFORE PCS. Most kids adapt within 3-6 months with proper support.

## School Options for Military Kids

## High School Credit Transfers

### The Challenge
- Different states = different graduation requirements
- Credits don't always transfer 1:1
- Could delay graduation

### How to Protect Credits

**Before PCS:**
1. Meet with counselor at CURRENT school
2. Get transcript showing credits earned
3. Ask: "What credits might not transfer?"
4. Take summer school courses to fill gaps (if needed)

**After PCS:**
1. Meet with counselor at NEW school immediately
2. Review credit transfer
3. Identify missing requirements
4. Create graduation plan

**Interstate Compact Protection:**
- If student is on track to graduate, new school MUST allow graduation even if missing state-specific requirements
- Applies to students in 11th-12th grade

## College Application Challenges (Military Kids)

### Transcript from Multiple Schools

**Reality:**
- Military kid attends 4-5 high schools
- Transcripts from all must be submitted
- Looks chaotic to admissions officers

**Solutions:**
- Create narrative essay explaining military lifestyle
- Highlight adaptability, resilience
- Many colleges give preference to military kids

### Residency for In-State Tuition

**Challenge:**
- You PCS every 2-3 years
- Never establish state residency
- Out-of-state tuition = $30,000/year vs. $10,000/year in-state

**Solutions:**
- **Military Interstate Children's Compact:** Many states grant in-state tuition to military dependents
- **Parent's Home of Record:** Some states allow student to claim parent's HOR for tuition purposes
- **Active Duty Stationed in State:** Some states grant in-state tuition if parent is stationed there

**Example:**
- You're stationed in Virginia
- Virginia grants in-state tuition to active duty dependents
- Kid attends UVA: $15,000/year vs. $50,000/year out-of-state
- **Savings: $35,000/year**

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Getting Transcripts Before PCS
**Reality:** You PCS. Old school takes 6 weeks to mail transcripts. Kid can't enroll in right courses.

**Fix:** Get official transcripts (3 copies) BEFORE you PCS. Hand-carry them.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Assuming All Schools Are Equal
**Reality:** You move from excellent DoDEA school to bottom-tier public school. Kid's education suffers.

**Fix:** Research school ratings. Choose housing based on school district quality.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Advocating for IEP Continuity
**Reality:** New school says "We need to evaluate before providing services." Kid goes 3 months without support.

**Fix:** Interstate Compact requires immediate services. Insist on it.

### ❌ Mistake #4: PCSing Mid-School Year
**Reality:** You PCS in February. Kid misses half of school year. Struggles to catch up.

**Fix:** Request summer PCS (if possible) to align with school calendar.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Explaining Military Lifestyle to Teachers
**Reality:** Teacher doesn't know you're military. Marks kid down for absences during PCS move.

**Fix:** Meet with teachers within first week. Explain military life. Most are understanding.
