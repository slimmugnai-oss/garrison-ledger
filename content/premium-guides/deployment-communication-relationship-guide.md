# Deployment Communication: Keeping Relationships Strong During Separation

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Successful deployment communication requires: Set realistic expectations (WiFi unreliable, email better than calls), establish communication schedule (even if it's "I'll email when I can"), use multiple platforms (email, WhatsApp, Facebook), send care packages monthly, avoid major relationship decisions during deployment. Average communication: Email 3-4x/week, video call 1-2x/month (if lucky). Quality > quantity. Focus on staying connected emotionally, not just logistically.

## The Deployment Communication Reality

### What Movies Show vs. Reality

**Movies:**
- Daily video calls
- Clear phone connection
- Romantic conversations

**Reality:**
- WiFi cuts out mid-sentence
- Can't say WHERE you are
- Conversations: "Hi, love you, gotta go" (2 minutes)
- Email preferred (can write anytime, sends when WiFi available)

### Communication Frequency by Deployment Type

**Combat deployment (Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria):**
- Email: 2-4x/week (when you have WiFi)
- Phone/video: 1-2x/month (maybe)
- Letters: 2 weeks delivery time

**Ship deployment (Navy):**
- Email: 3-5x/week (limited WiFi at sea)
- Phone: Only when in port (every 2-4 weeks)
- Letters: 3-4 weeks delivery

**OCONUS non-combat (Korea, Japan, Europe):**
- Email/WhatsApp: Daily
- Video calls: 2-3x/week
- Normal communication (just time zone difference)

**TDY/Training (CONUS):**
- Phone: Daily (usually)
- Video: Nightly (if WiFi)
- Like long-distance relationship, not deployment

## Best Communication Platforms for Deployment

### Email (Most Reliable)

**Why email is #1:**
- ✅ Doesn't require both online at same time
- ✅ Works even with spotty WiFi (sends when connected)
- ✅ Can write long messages (express thoughts fully)
- ✅ No OPSEC violations (doesn't show location like FaceTime metadata)

**Best practices:**
- Write emails offline, send when WiFi available
- Don't expect immediate replies (could be 2-3 days)
- Share daily details ("Today I...")

### WhatsApp / Facebook Messenger

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Works internationally (free)
- ✅ Shows "last seen" (you know they're alive even if no message)
- ✅ Photo/video sharing easy
- ✅ End-to-end encrypted (WhatsApp)

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Requires WiFi/data
- ❌ "Last seen" can cause anxiety ("He was online but didn't message me!")

### Video Calls (FaceTime, Skype, WhatsApp Video)

**Reality:**
- Rare during combat deployments (1-2x/month if lucky)
- More common on ships in port, non-combat deployments
- Plan for time zones (you may need to wake up at 3 AM)

**Best practices:**
- Schedule in advance (don't expect spontaneous calls)
- Have backup plan if WiFi fails mid-call
- Keep calls positive (don't waste limited time arguing)

### Letters / Care Packages

**Why old-school mail still matters:**
- ✅ Physical connection (can hold letter, smell perfume)
- ✅ Works when ALL tech fails
- ✅ Can be reread multiple times
- ✅ Shows effort (handwritten = meaningful)

**Delivery time:**
- APO/FPO address: 10-21 days
- Some locations: 4-6 weeks

## Communication Schedule & Expectations

### Setting Realistic Expectations Before Deployment

**Conversation to have:**
- "I'll email you 3-4x/week, but responses might be delayed."
- "Phone calls will be rare. Don't panic if you don't hear from me for 1-2 weeks."
- "If something bad happens, you'll get official notification (casualty assistance), not social media."

**What NOT to expect:**
- ❌ Daily phone calls
- ❌ Instant responses to texts
- ❌ Long romantic video calls
- ❌ Predictable communication schedule

### Managing Time Zones

**Example: You're in California, they're in Afghanistan (12.5 hours ahead)**

**Their schedule:**
- 6 AM Afghanistan = 5:30 PM California (you're off work) ✅
- 10 PM Afghanistan = 9:30 AM California (you're at work) ❌

**Best time to catch them:** Early morning or late evening your time

**Tools:**
- World Time Buddy (compare time zones)
- Set their time zone on second clock (iPhone Clock app)

### When Communication Goes Silent

**Reasons for no contact:**
- Mission in progress (can't access WiFi/email)
- WiFi down (happens weekly in some locations)
- OPSEC blackout (before/during major operation)
- Just busy (12-hour shifts, exhausted)

**What to do:**
- Wait 7 days before worrying
- Send supportive messages (even if no reply)
- Don't call commander (embarrassing for them unless true emergency)

---

## What to Talk About (& What to Avoid)

### Good Topics (Keep Morale Up)

**Share daily life:**
- "Kids did XYZ today"
- "I tried new recipe (disaster! lol)"
- "Dog misses you (include photo)"

**Funny stories:**
- Light, positive, distracting
- Reminds them of normal life

**Plans for R&R / homecoming:**
- "When you're back, let's..."
- Gives them something to look forward to

**Your support:**
- "I'm proud of you"
- "We're okay here, don't worry about us"
- "Counting down days until you're home"

### Topics to AVOID

**Don't dump problems:**
- ❌ "Car broke down, I don't know what to do!" (they can't fix it from 7,000 miles away)
- ✅ "Car broke down, I called mechanic, handled it. Miss you!"

**Don't complain about missing them (too much):**
- ❌ "I'm so lonely, I hate this, I can't do this anymore"
- ✅ "I miss you, but I'm staying busy with [hobby/friends]"

**Don't start fights:**
- ❌ "We need to talk about [serious relationship issue]"
- ✅ Save serious talks for homecoming (face-to-face)

**Don't share scary news:**
- ❌ "Your grandma might die soon"
- ✅ Tell them ONLY if it happens (they can't do anything from deployment)

**Don't ask "Where are you?":**
- ❌ They can't tell you (OPSEC)
- ✅ They'll share what they can

## Care Packages (Physical Connection)

### What to Send

**Food (Non-perishable):**
- Beef jerky, protein bars, trail mix
- Hard candy, gum
- Coffee, hot cocoa packets
- **Avoid:** Chocolate (melts), glass jars (break)

**Hygiene:**
- Baby wipes (gold during deployment)
- Chapstick, sunscreen, lotion
- Shampoo/body wash (if they don't have access to PX)

**Entertainment:**
- Books, magazines
- Playing cards, travel games
- Downloaded movies on USB drive
- Crossword puzzles, Sudoku

**Personal:**
- Handwritten letters
- Photos of family/kids
- Item with your perfume/cologne
- Kids' drawings

**Practical:**
- Socks (always needed)
- Batteries (AA, AAA)
- Phone charging cables
- Headlamp / flashlight

### How to Send Care Packages

**Address format (APO/FPO):**
```
Rank First Last Name
Unit Name
APO/FPO [location code] [ZIP]
```

**Shipping:**
- USPS only (UPS/FedEx don't deliver to APO/FPO)
- Flat-rate boxes: $25-$30 (unlimited weight, best value)
- Priority Mail: 10-21 days delivery

**Packing tips:**
- Tape box like you're mailing a bomb (it'll get beaten up)
- Ziplock bags for everything (dust gets in)
- Fill empty space (bubble wrap, packing peanuts)
- Customs form: Be honest (but "Snacks" not "Doritos x20")

**Frequency:**
- 1 package per month = great
- Don't stress if you can't afford it (communication matters more)

## Managing Emotional Distance

### The "Deployment Bubble" Effect

**What happens:**
- They're in survival mode (focus on mission, buddies, staying alive)
- You're in maintaining mode (home, kids, bills, loneliness)
- You grow apart emotionally (temporarily)

**Normal feelings:**
- "I'm fine without them" (then guilt)
- "Do they even miss me?" (they do, but can't show it)
- "We have nothing to talk about" (lived different experiences for 6-12 months)

**Fix:**
- This is TEMPORARY
- Reconnection takes time after homecoming (2-6 months)
- Give grace to each other

### Avoiding Deployment Relationship Killers

**Don't make major decisions:**
- ❌ "I want a divorce"
- ❌ "Let's buy a house"
- ❌ "I'm pregnant" (if not planned)

**Wait until they're home for 3-6 months** (post-deployment adjustment period)

**Don't let resentment build:**
- Talk about small issues early (via email)
- Don't explode with 6 months of bottled anger when they return

**Don't isolate yourself:**
- Stay connected to friends, family, FRG
- "I'm fine alone" turns into depression
- Social support = crucial

## Reunion & Reintegration

### First 48 Hours (Honeymoon Phase)

**What to expect:**
- Excitement, relief, sex
- Everything feels perfect
- "We're never fighting again!"

### Week 1-2 (Adjustment Phase)

**What to expect:**
- They're different (detached, hypervigilant, irritable)
- You're different (independent, routines changed)
- Kids act out (testing boundaries)

**Common conflicts:**
- "You're not the parent, I've been handling this for 9 months"
- "I don't fit into my own family anymore"

**Fix:**
- Communicate expectations
- Slowly reintegrate them (don't overhaul routines overnight)
- Be patient (adjustment takes 2-6 months)

### Months 1-3 (New Normal)

**Getting back on same page:**
- Weekly check-ins (how are we doing?)
- Marriage counseling if needed (Military OneSource = free)
- Date nights (rebuild emotional connection)
- Rediscover each other (you both changed)

**Remember:** Deployment communication is hard. WiFi sucks, time zones suck, distance sucks. But your relationship CAN survive (many do). Set realistic expectations, communicate when possible, send care packages, and focus on quality > quantity. Reunion is coming. You've got this.
