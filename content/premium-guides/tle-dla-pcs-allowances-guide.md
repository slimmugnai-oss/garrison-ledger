# TLE & DLA: Maximizing Your PCS Allowances (2025 Guide)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** TLE (Temporary Lodging Expense) pays for hotel/food for 10 days during PCS ($290-$440/day depending on location). DLA (Dislocation Allowance) is a lump sum ($2,000-$4,000) to offset PCS costs. Most service members don't use their full TLE days and leave $2,000-$3,000 unclaimed.

## Maximizing TLE (Strategy Guide)

### Strategy #1: Use BOTH Departure and Arrival TLE
**Many service members only claim arrival TLE and miss out on $1,500-$2,000.**

**How to use departure TLE:**
- Move out of quarters/housing 5 days before final out
- Stay in hotel while finishing out-processing
- Claim 5 days TLE at departing location

**How to use arrival TLE:**
- Don't rush into first apartment you see
- Use full 10 days to house-hunt
- Stay in hotel, claim TLE, find BEST housing option

**Total TLE possible:**
- Departure: 5 days × $440 = $2,200
- Arrival: 10 days × $440 = $4,400
- **Total: $6,600**

### Strategy #2: Stay in Extended Stay Hotels
**Why:**
- Often cheaper than standard hotels ($100-$150/night vs. $180-$250)
- Includes kitchen (save on meals)
- More space for family

**TLE still reimburses full rate:**
- If TLE rate is $440/day
- Hotel costs $120/night
- You pocket the difference? NO — TLE reimburses ACTUAL costs up to max

**Correction:** TLE reimburses actual lodging + per diem. You can't pocket difference, but staying cheap maximizes your reimbursement relative to what you spend out-of-pocket.

### Strategy #3: Combine TLE with House-Hunting Trip
**If authorized a house-hunting trip (HHT) before PCS:**
- Use HHT to narrow down housing options
- Use TLE upon arrival to finalize lease
- Don't waste TLE days on initial research

### Strategy #4: Document Everything
**Keep receipts for:**
- Hotel bills (itemized)
- Rental car (if needed for house-hunting)
- Meals (covered by per diem, but good to track)

**Take photos:**
- House-hunting activities
- Appointments with realtors/landlords
- Proof you were actively searching

**Why:** Finance sometimes audits TLE claims. Proof = faster approval.

## DLA Strategy (How to Use It Wisely)

### Strategy #1: Plan Upfront Costs Before PCS
**Typical upfront costs at new location:**
- Security deposit: $1,500-$3,000
- First month's rent: $1,500-$3,000
- Utility deposits: $200-$500
- Furniture (if needed): $1,000-$3,000
- Pet deposit: $300-$500
- **Total: $4,500-$10,500**

**DLA covers:** $2,000-$4,000 (depending on rank)

**Gap:** $500-$6,500 out-of-pocket

**Solution:** Save 2-3 months before PCS to cover gap between DLA and actual costs.

### Strategy #2: Don't Spend DLA Before It Arrives
**Common mistake:**
- Assume DLA will arrive immediately
- Spend money on deposits/furniture
- DLA takes 2-3 weeks to arrive
- Run out of cash

**Better approach:**
- Use emergency fund or credit card for upfront costs
- Pay off credit card when DLA arrives
- Avoid interest charges

### Strategy #3: Use DLA for Quality-of-Life Improvements
**If your upfront costs are LOW (e.g., living on-base, no deposits):**
- Use DLA for:
  - Better furniture
  - Home office setup (if telework eligible)
  - Kids' school supplies/activities
  - Pet care (vet, kennel during move)

**Remember:** DLA is NOT taxable income. Spend it wisely, but you earned it.

## OCONUS TLE (Special Rules)

### TLA (Temporary Lodging Allowance) for OCONUS
**Different from TLE:**
- OCONUS version is called TLA
- Higher daily rates (covers foreign housing costs)
- Up to 60 days (vs. 10 days TLE CONUS)

**Rates (examples):**
- **Germany:** €200-€300/day (~$220-$330 USD)
- **Japan:** ¥30,000-¥45,000/day (~$200-$300 USD)
- **South Korea:** ₩250,000-₩350,000/day (~$180-$250 USD)

**Claiming TLA:**
- Same process as TLE (file in DTS)
- Keep receipts for lodging
- Per diem automatically calculated

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Claiming Departure TLE
**Reality:** You leave $2,000 on the table.

**Fix:** Request 5 days departure TLE when filing travel voucher.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Rushing Into First Apartment (Wasting TLE)
**Reality:** You sign lease on Day 2, use only 2 TLE days, lose $3,200 in reimbursement.

**Fix:** Use full 10 days to find BEST housing. You're paid to house-hunt — use the time.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Losing Receipts
**Reality:** Finance denies your TLE claim. You're out $4,400.

**Fix:** Take photos of receipts immediately. Store in Google Drive/cloud.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Filing Travel Voucher Within 5 Days
**Reality:** You miss the deadline. Finance rejects claim.

**Fix:** File voucher IMMEDIATELY after completing travel. Don't wait.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Assuming DLA Will Cover Everything
**Reality:** DLA is $3,000. Your upfront costs are $7,000. You're $4,000 short.

**Fix:** Save 2-3 months before PCS. DLA is a BONUS, not a full reimbursement.
