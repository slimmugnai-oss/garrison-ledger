## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Using MyCAA Before Cutoff
**Reality:** Wait to get training. Spouse promotes to E-6. Lose $4,000 benefit.

**Fix:** Use MyCAA ASAP if eligible (spouse E-1 to E-5).

### ❌ Mistake #2: Pursuing State-Specific Career
**Reality:** Get RN license in Texas. PCS to California. Must re-apply for CA license ($500, 6 weeks).

**Fix:** Choose careers with multi-state portability (NLC for nursing, remote work, federal jobs).

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Building Network
**Reality:** Start job search from scratch every PCS. No referrals, no connections.

**Fix:** Join military spouse professional groups (MSEP, LinkedIn groups). Network carries over PCS.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Giving Up After One PCS Derails Career
**Reality:** Lose job due to PCS. Give up. Become unemployed for years.

**Fix:** Pivot to remote/portable career. Each PCS is opportunity to restart smarter.
