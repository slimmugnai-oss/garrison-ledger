# PCS House Hunting Trip: Planning, Budgeting & Finding the Right Home

**Bottom Line Up Front:** House hunting trips (HHT) authorized for most PCS moves (not all). Duration: 10 days max (use wisely). Government reimburses: Travel (flights, mileage), lodging ($100-$200/day depending on location), per diem ($50-$75/day for meals). Bring spouse (authorized dependent). Plan ahead: Research neighborhoods online BEFORE trip, schedule 10-15 property viewings, bring checkbook (rental deposits due immediately). Success rate: 70-80% find housing during HHT. Alternative: Virtual house hunting (photos, video tours) if HHT not authorized or prefer to save leave days.

## What Is a House Hunting Trip?

### Purpose

**Official reason:** Find permanent housing at new duty station before PCS

**Practical benefit:**
- See neighborhood in person (vs. online photos)

**NOT authorized:**
- Moving to barracks (single E-4 and below typically)
- Some short-distance PCS (<50 miles)

**Check your orders:** "House hunting trip authorized: YES/NO" (if not listed, ask TMO)

### Duration

**Maximum:** 10 days (from departure to return)

**Includes:**
- Travel days (1-2 days each way if flying)
- Actual house hunting (5-8 days)

**Example:**
- Day 1: Fly to new duty station
- Days 2-8: View houses, sign lease

## Planning Your HHT (Maximize 10 Days)

### 60 Days Before Trip

**Online research:**
- Neighborhoods: Crime rates, schools, commute time
- Housing availability: Zillow, Apartments.com, Craigslist
- Price ranges: What can you afford with BAH?

**Create shortlist:**
- 10-15 properties (addresses, contact info)
- Mix of options (backup if first choice falls through)

**Schedule viewings:**
- Call landlords/realtors: "I'm PCS'ing, will be in town [dates], can I see property?"
- Schedule 2-3 viewings per day (spread out geographically)

**Book travel:**
- Flights: Book early (cheaper)
- Hotel: Near base OR central to properties viewing
- Rental car: If needed (some cities = walkable/Uber works)

### 30 Days Before

**Gather documents:**
- Pay stubs / LES (prove income for rental application)
- Credit report (pull free report from AnnualCreditReport.com)
- Reference letters (previous landlords)
- PCS orders (prove you're moving)

**Create "renter packet":**
- All docs in folder
- Makes application easier (landlords appreciate preparedness)

**Prepare questions for landlords:**
- Lease terms (12 months? Can you break lease if PCS early?)
- Utilities (what's included? Average electric/water bill?)
- Pet policy (if you have pets)
- Move-in costs (first month, last month, deposit?)

### During HHT (Daily Schedule)

**Example Day:**

**9 AM:** Property #1 viewing (house near base)
- Pros: Close commute, good schools
- Cons: High rent, small yard

**11 AM:** Property #2 viewing (apartment 15 min from base)
- Pros: Affordable, pool/gym
- Cons: Older building, no washer/dryer

**1 PM:** Lunch, review notes

**2 PM:** Property #3 viewing (townhouse)
- Pros: Updated, garage
- Cons: 25-min commute

**4 PM:** Return to hotel, compare options

**Evening:** Apply to top choice (online application)

**Repeat daily until house found**

## What to Look for During Viewings

### Neighborhood Assessment

**Drive around:**
- Time of day matters (quiet at 10 AM, noisy at 6 PM?)
- Check neighbors (well-maintained yards = good sign)
- Parking (street parking available? Garage?)

**Commute test:**
- Drive from property to base (during rush hour if possible)
- 30+ min commute = gets old fast

**Schools:**
- If you have kids, drive past schools
- Check GreatSchools.org ratings

**Safety:**
- Check CrimeReports.com
- Ask neighbors ("Do you feel safe here?")

### Property Inspection

**Outside:**
- Roof condition (missing shingles = leaks)
- Foundation (cracks = expensive repairs)
- Landscaping (overgrown = landlord neglectful?)

**Inside:**
- Turn on every faucet (water pressure good?)
- Flush toilets (work properly?)
- Test stove, dishwasher, AC/heat
- Open closets (enough storage?)
- Check for mold (especially bathrooms, basement)
- Cell phone signal (spotty coverage?)

**Red flags:**
- Strong smells (mold, pets, smoke)
- Water stains (ceiling = roof leak)
- Bug infestation (roaches, ants)

### Military-Friendly Landlords

**Ask:**
- "Have you rented to military before?"
- "Do you offer lease break clauses for PCS?"

**Military-friendly = gold:**
- Understand deployments, PCS
- Flexible lease terms
- No penalty for early termination (with orders)

**Find military-friendly:**
- Base housing office (off-base housing referrals)
- Facebook groups ("[Base Name] Housing")
- MilitaryByOwner.com

## Making the Decision

### Compare Options (Scoring System)

**Create spreadsheet:**

| Property | Rent | Commute | Condition | Pet-Friendly | Score |
|----------|------|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| House A  | $1800| 10 min  | Good      | Yes          | 8/10  |
| Apt B    | $1200| 20 min  | Fair      | No           | 6/10  |
| Town C   | $1600| 25 min  | Excellent | Yes          | 9/10  |

**Factors to weight:**
- Rent (within BAH?)
- Commute (quality of life)
- Condition (avoid fixer-uppers as renter)
- Schools (if kids)
- Pet policy (if pets)

**Choose top 2-3:** Apply to all (in case one falls through)

### Applying & Signing Lease

**Application process:**
- Fill out online (or paper)
- Pay application fee ($50-$100)
- Credit check, background check
- Approval: 24-48 hours

**If approved:**
- Sign lease (read ENTIRE lease first)
- Pay deposit + first month (cashier's check or money order)
- Get keys OR arrange move-in date

**Military lease clause:**
- Ensure lease has SCRA clause: "Lease can be broken with 30 days notice + PCS orders"
- Protects you if you PCS unexpectedly

## Alternatives to House Hunting Trip

### Virtual House Hunting

**If HHT not authorized OR you can't take 10 days leave:**

**Virtual tools:**
- Zillow 3D tours (walk through property virtually)
- FaceTime tours (ask landlord to video call while showing property)
- Google Street View (check neighborhood)

**Pros:**
- ✅ No travel costs
- ✅ No leave days used
- ✅ Can view more properties (not limited to 10 days)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Can't see condition in person (photos lie)
- ❌ Can't test commute
- ❌ Risky (sign lease sight-unseen)

**Best practice:**
- Virtual hunt to narrow down
- Send trusted friend/family to view in person
- OR accept risk (many military do this, mostly works out)

### Temporary Lodging → House Hunt After Arrival

**Option:** Skip HHT, use TLE (Temporary Lodging Expense) after PCS

**How it works:**
1. PCS to new base
2. Move into hotel (TLE covers 10 days)
3. House hunt locally
4. Move into permanent housing by day 10

**Pros:**
- ✅ See properties in person
- ✅ No rushed decision (can view more than 10-15)
- ✅ Already at new location (easier logistics)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Living out of hotel (stressful with kids)
- ❌ 10-day pressure (TLE limit)
- ❌ HHG shipment may arrive before housing found

## Common HHT Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Only Viewing 3-4 Properties

**Reality:**
- View 4 houses
- Don't like any
- Out of time, settle for mediocre place

**Fix:** Schedule 10-15 viewings (build buffer)

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Bringing Checkbook

**Reality:**
- Find perfect house
- "I'll apply when I get home"
- Someone else rents it next day

**Fix:** Bring checkbook, be ready to apply on spot

### ❌ Mistake #3: Exceeding BAH Budget

**Reality:**
- BAH: $2,000/month
- Fall in love with $2,500 house
- Sign lease → Out-of-pocket $500/month = $6,000/year

**Fix:** Stick to BAH budget (or slightly under)

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Reading Lease

**Reality:**
- Sign lease without reading
- Later discover: No PCS clause, can't break lease early
- Stuck paying rent after PCSing OR lose security deposit

**Fix:** Read entire lease, ensure military PCS clause included

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Saving Receipts

**Reality:**
- Spend $2,000 on HHT (flights, hotel, meals)
- Don't save receipts
- Can't get reimbursed → Out-of-pocket $2,000

**Fix:** Save EVERY receipt (photo backup)

Save receipts (government reimburses flights, hotel, meals). Most find housing during HHT - you can too.
