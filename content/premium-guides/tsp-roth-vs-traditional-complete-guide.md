# TSP Roth vs Traditional: The Complete Decision Framework

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Choose Roth TSP if you're junior enlisted or expect higher future tax rates. Choose Traditional TSP if you're senior/officer or need immediate tax breaks. Most service members benefit from a 60/40 Traditional/Roth split.

## Quick Decision Tool

### Choose Traditional TSP if:
- ✅ You're O-4+ or E-7+ (high current tax bracket)
- ✅ You need a lower taxable income NOW (e.g., to qualify for benefits)
- ✅ You expect to have lower income in retirement
- ✅ You're currently deployed to a combat zone (still get tax-free growth)
- ✅ You're maxing out at $23,000/year (2025 limit)

### Choose Roth TSP if:
- ✅ You're E-1 to E-6 (low current tax bracket)
- ✅ You're early in your career (20+ years to retirement)
- ✅ You expect tax rates to increase significantly
- ✅ You want tax-free withdrawals in retirement
- ✅ You're deployed and earning tax-free income (maximize this!)

### Best of Both: 60/40 Traditional/Roth
Most service members should split contributions to hedge against future tax uncertainty.

## The Math Behind Each Option

### Traditional TSP
**How it works:**
- Contributions reduce your taxable income TODAY
- Money grows tax-deferred
- Pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement

**Example: E-5 contributing $500/month**
- Current tax bracket: 12%
- Tax savings per year: $720 (12% of $6,000)
- At retirement: Pay taxes on full withdrawal amount

**Advantage:** Immediate tax break, lower taxable income for benefit eligibility

### Roth TSP
**How it works:**
- Contributions made with AFTER-TAX money (no immediate deduction)
- Money grows tax-free
- Withdrawals in retirement are 100% tax-free

**Example: E-5 contributing $500/month**
- Current tax bracket: 12%
- Pay $720 in taxes upfront
- At retirement: $0 taxes on withdrawals (even on growth!)

**Advantage:** Tax-free growth and withdrawals, hedge against future rate increases

## Tax Rate Reality Check

### Current Federal Tax Brackets (2025)

| **Income Range (Single)** | **Tax Rate** | **Typical Ranks** |
|---------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| $0 - $11,600 | 10% | E-1 to E-3 |
| $11,600 - $47,150 | 12% | E-4 to E-6 |
| $47,150 - $100,525 | 22% | E-7 to E-9, O-1 to O-3 |
| $100,525 - $191,950 | 24% | O-4 to O-6 |
| $191,950 - $243,725 | 32% | O-6+ |
| $243,725+ | 35-37% | Flag officers |

**Key Insight:** If you're in the 10-12% bracket NOW but expect to be in the 22%+ bracket in retirement, Roth wins big.

### Retirement Tax Reality
Most military retirees have:
- Military pension (taxable)
- Social Security (partially taxable)
- TSP withdrawals (Traditional = fully taxable)
- Rental income, dividends, etc.

**This can easily push you into the 22-24% bracket** — higher than most junior enlisted pay now.

## By Rank Recommendations

### E-1 to E-4: 80% Roth / 20% Traditional
**Why:**
- You're in the 10-12% tax bracket (lowest possible)
- Locking in these rates is a massive advantage
- You have 15-20+ years for tax-free growth
- Even a small pension will push you higher in retirement

**Real Example:**
- PFC contributing $300/month Roth TSP for 20 years
- At 7% annual return: $147,000 balance
- **Tax bill at withdrawal: $0** (vs. $32,340 at 22% Traditional)

### E-5 to E-6: 60% Traditional / 40% Roth
**Why:**
- You're in the 12-22% bracket (moderate)
- Hedging is smart — split the difference
- You can adjust as your career progresses
- Balances tax break now with tax-free later

### E-7 to E-9: 70% Traditional / 30% Roth
**Why:**
- You're in the 22-24% bracket (higher)
- Tax break NOW is more valuable
- But keep some Roth for tax diversification
- Your pension will be substantial

### O-1 to O-3: 60% Traditional / 40% Roth
**Why:**
- Similar to senior enlisted (22% bracket)
- Early career = more time for Roth growth
- Officer pension will be significant

### O-4+: 80% Traditional / 20% Roth
**Why:**
- You're in the 24-32% bracket (high)
- Immediate tax savings are substantial
- Your retirement income will still likely be lower than active duty

## Combat Zone Special Rules

**THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE YOU'LL EVER LEARN:**

### Tax-Free Income + Roth TSP = Pure Gold

When you're in a designated combat zone (CZTE):
- Your pay is **TAX-FREE** (up to general officer pay cap)
- You can contribute to **Roth TSP** using this tax-free money
- Result: **TAX-FREE IN, TAX-FREE GROWTH, TAX-FREE OUT**

**This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.**

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Switch to 100% Roth TSP** before deployment
2. Max out contributions ($23,000 annual limit in 2025)
3. If possible, contribute $46,000+ with catch-up (over age 50)
4. After deployment, switch back to your normal mix

**Real Example:**
- SSG deployed for 12 months
- Earns $50,000 combat pay (tax-free)
- Contributes $23,000 to Roth TSP
- At retirement: $0 taxes on this money forever
- **Effective tax rate: 0% instead of 22%** = $5,060 savings

## The Blended Retirement System (BRS) Factor

### BRS 5% Match Rules
- Government matches up to 5% of your base pay
- **Match goes into Traditional TSP** (you can't choose Roth for match)
- This means you ALWAYS have some Traditional TSP balance

**Implication:**
- Even if you contribute 100% Roth, you'll build a Traditional balance from match
- This creates automatic tax diversification
- You can be more aggressive with Roth contributions

### Legacy High-3 System
- No match, so your choice is purely personal
- Consider going heavier Roth since you won't get forced Traditional contributions

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: "I'll just do all Traditional because I want the tax break"
**Reality:** You're paying 12% now to avoid paying 22-24% later. That's backwards.

### ❌ Mistake #2: "I'll just do all Roth because tax-free sounds better"
**Reality:** If you're O-5 in the 32% bracket, you're giving up $7,680/year in tax savings ($24,000 contribution × 32%). That's not smart.

### ❌ Mistake #3: "I'll figure this out later"
**Reality:** You can't go back in time. A deployed E-4 who misses the Roth CZTE opportunity loses $50,000+ in lifetime tax savings.

### ❌ Mistake #4: "I'll change my contributions every year based on tax rates"
**Reality:** Set it and forget it. Consistency beats optimization.

### ❌ Mistake #5: "Roth is always better because taxes will go up"
**Reality:** Even if rates increase, you still need to compare YOUR rate now vs. YOUR rate in retirement. An O-6 at 32% is unlikely to have a higher retirement rate.

## Advanced Strategies

### The "Tax Bracket Arbitrage" Strategy
1. Contribute Traditional TSP to stay in the 12% bracket
2. Once you hit the 22% bracket threshold, switch remaining contributions to Roth
3. Example: E-6 earning $55,000 — contribute first $7,850 Traditional (to stay in 12%), rest Roth

### The "Mega Roth Deployment" Strategy
1. Year before deployment: Max Traditional TSP to build up cash
2. During deployment: Max Roth TSP with tax-free combat pay
3. After deployment: Return to balanced approach
4. Result: Lifetime tax savings of $10,000+

### The "Retirement Tax Planning" Strategy
1. Contribute mostly Traditional during high-earning years
2. In early retirement (age 60-72), convert Traditional to Roth slowly
3. Pay taxes at low rates during low-income years
4. Result: Tax-free Roth withdrawals later
