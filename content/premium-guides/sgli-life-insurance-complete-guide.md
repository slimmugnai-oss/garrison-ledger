## SGLI vs. Civilian Life Insurance

### Comparison (30-Year-Old E-5, $500,000 Coverage)

| **Type** | **Monthly Cost** | **Coverage** | **Exam Required?** | **Portable?** |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| SGLI | $32 | $500,000 | No | No (ends at separation) |
| USAA Term Life | $35-$50 | $500,000 | Yes | Yes |
| Navy Federal Term | $30-$45 | $500,000 | Yes | Yes |
| Whole Life (Northwestern Mutual) | $250-$400 | $500,000 | Yes | Yes |

## Common SGLI Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Never Updating Beneficiary
**Reality:** You marry, have kids, divorce, remarry. Beneficiary still lists ex-girlfriend from 10 years ago.

**Fix:** Update beneficiary after EVERY major life event.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Declining SGLI to "Save Money"
**Reality:** You save $32/month ($384/year). You die. Family gets $0.

**Fix:** Keep SGLI. It's the cheapest, most comprehensive life insurance you'll ever have.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Getting Spousal SGLI
**Reality:** Spouse dies. You have funeral costs ($10,000), no life insurance payout.

**Fix:** Get spousal SGLI ($100,000 for $6-$10/month). Worth it.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Converting SGLI to VGLI After Separation
**Reality:** You separate. SGLI ends 120 days later. You develop cancer. Can't get civilian insurance. No life insurance.

**Fix:** Convert to VGLI within 240 days of separation (no medical exam required).

### ❌ Mistake #5: Thinking SGLI Is Enough
**Reality:** You have spouse + 3 kids. $500,000 sounds like a lot, but after paying off house ($300,000), only $200,000 left for family.

**Fix:** Calculate actual needs. Get additional civilian term life if needed ($250,000-$500,000).
