# DITY/PPM Move: The Complete 2025 Guide to Maximizing Your Profit

**Bottom Line Up Front:** A properly executed PPM (Personally Procured Move) can net you $3,000-$8,000 profit. The key is accurate weight tickets, organized receipts, and understanding the 95% reimbursement rule. Most service members leave $2,000+ on the table by not claiming all eligible expenses.

## What Is a PPM?

### Definition
A **Personally Procured Move (PPM)**, formerly called DITY (Do-It-Yourself), is when you move your household goods yourself instead of using the government's contracted movers.

### How You Get Paid
The military estimates what it would cost to hire movers and pays you **95% of that estimate**. If you move for less than that amount, you pocket the difference.

**Example:**
- Government's estimated cost: $8,000
- You receive: $7,600 (95% of $8,000)
- Your actual costs: $4,500
- **Your profit: $3,100**

## PPM vs. Government Move

| **Factor** | **PPM (You Move)** | **Government Move (TMO)** |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Control | Full control over timeline | Movers come when scheduled |
| Profit potential | $3,000-$8,000 | $0 |
| Effort | High (you do everything) | Low (they do everything) |
| Risk | You're responsible for damage | Movers are liable |
| Weight limit | Same as government move | Same |
| Best for | Young, single, willing to work | Families, lots of stuff, busy |

## The PPM Process (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Get Orders & Approval
1. Receive PCS orders
2. Log into [Move.mil](https://move.mil)
3. Select "PPM (DITY) Move"
4. Get estimated reimbursement amount
5. Get written approval from TMO

**DO NOT move before approval or you won't get paid!**

### Step 2: Get EMPTY Weight Ticket
1. Rent U-Haul, Penske, or truck
2. **BEFORE loading:** Drive to certified scale
3. Get weight ticket showing EMPTY weight
4. Common scales: CAT Scale, truck stops, landfills, recycling centers

**Critical:** Weight ticket must show:
- Date and time
- Vehicle license plate
- Empty weight
- Scale location
- Certified scale stamp

### Step 3: Load & Move
- Pack your vehicle
- Drive to new duty station
- Save ALL receipts

### Step 4: Get FULL Weight Ticket
1. **AFTER loading:** Drive to same or different certified scale
2. Get weight ticket showing FULL weight
3. Your reimbursement is based on the difference

**Formula:**
```
Net Weight = Full Weight - Empty Weight
Reimbursement = Government Estimate × 95%
Profit = Reimbursement - Your Actual Costs
```

### Step 5: Submit Your PPM Claim
1. Log into Move.mil within 45 days of move completion
2. Upload:
   - Empty weight tickets
   - Full weight tickets
   - Rental truck receipts
   - Fuel receipts
   - Lodging receipts (if claiming TLE)
   - Tolls, parking, etc.
3. TMO reviews and approves
4. Payment arrives 7-14 days after approval

## Maximizing Your PPM Profit

### Strategy #1: Rent the Right Size Truck
- **Too small:** Multiple trips = more cost
- **Too big:** Heavier vehicle = less net weight allowed
- **Sweet spot:** 15-17 foot truck for most E-5/E-6 households

### Strategy #2: Maximize Net Weight
- Include everything you're allowed:
  - Furniture
  - Boxes
  - Appliances
  - Tools
  - Sports equipment
  - Even heavy items you might normally leave behind

**Pro Tip:** Don't throw away that old couch before PCS — it adds weight!

### Strategy #3: Get Multiple Weight Tickets
- Some service members do partial PPM + government move
- Move heavy stuff yourself (for profit)
- Government moves fragile/bulky items (for safety)

### Strategy #4: Claim ALL Eligible Expenses
**Reimbursable:**
- ✅ Truck rental
- ✅ Fuel
- ✅ Tolls
- ✅ Moving equipment (dollies, straps, blankets)
- ✅ Packing materials (boxes, tape, bubble wrap)
- ✅ Storage fees (if authorized)

**NOT Reimbursable:**
- ❌ Meals during travel
- ❌ Your time/labor
- ❌ Helper labor (but worth it for profit)

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### ❌ Mistake #1: Moving Before TMO Approval
**Result:** You don't get reimbursed at all. $0.

**Fix:** Get written approval FIRST. Log into Move.mil, submit your PPM request, wait for approval.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Forgetting Empty Weight Ticket
**Result:** Claim denied. You lose $5,000+.

**Fix:** Empty weight FIRST, then load, then full weight.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Weight Tickets Without Certification
**Result:** TMO rejects your claim.

**Fix:** Use only certified scales (CAT Scale, truck stops with "certified" stamp).

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Saving Receipts
**Result:** Can't claim expenses, reducing your profit.

**Fix:** Take photos of every receipt. Use an app like Expensify or just store in Google Drive.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Exceeding Weight Allowance
**Result:** Government only pays for your authorized weight. Overage is out-of-pocket.

**Fix:** Check your weight allowance on Move.mil BEFORE moving. Typical allowances:
- E-1 to E-5: 8,000-11,000 lbs
- E-6 to E-9: 12,000-14,500 lbs
- O-1 to O-3: 12,500-14,000 lbs
- O-4+: 16,000-18,000 lbs

## PPM + Partial Government Move (Hybrid Strategy)

### How It Works
- Government moves 80% of your weight allowance
- You PPM the remaining 20%

### Why Do This?
- Get paid for the PPM portion (profit)
- Government handles heavy furniture (less work for you)
- Lower risk of damage

**Example:**
- Total weight allowance: 12,000 lbs
- Government moves: 9,600 lbs (80%)
- You PPM: 2,400 lbs (20%)
- You still profit $1,500-$2,500 on the PPM portion

**Remember:** A PPM is work, but it's also $3,000-$8,000 of TAX-FREE profit. For a junior enlisted member, that's 1-2 months of base pay for a weekend of effort. Worth it.
