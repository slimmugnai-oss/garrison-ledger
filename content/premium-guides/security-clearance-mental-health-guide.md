# Security Clearance & Mental Health: What You Can (and Can't) Do Without Losing Clearance

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Seeking mental health treatment does NOT automatically disqualify you from security clearance. What matters: Are you a security risk (foreign influence, blackmail vulnerability, inability to handle classified info)? Safe: TRICARE therapy, Military OneSource counseling, voluntary PTSD treatment, depression/anxiety medication. Red flags: Refusing treatment, hiding treatment, psychosis, inability to distinguish reality, being hospitalized involuntarily. SF-86 asks about specific issues (not "Have you ever seen a therapist?"). Honesty is key - lying on clearance forms = automatic denial. Thousands hold clearances while treating PTSD, depression, anxiety.

## Mental Health Treatment vs. Security Clearance (The Truth)

### The Myth

**FALSE:** "If I see a therapist, I'll lose my clearance"

**Reality:** Mental health treatment alone does NOT disqualify you

### What Actually Matters for Clearance

**Adjudication Guideline I (Psychological Conditions)**

**Security concern:** Does your condition impair:
- Judgment
- Stability
- Reliability
- Ability to protect classified information

**Questions they ask:**
1. Are you currently a security risk?
2. Is your condition under control/being treated?
3. Are you compliant with treatment?
4. Can you handle stress/pressure?

**Treatment + compliance = GOOD (shows responsibility)**  
**Untreated mental health crisis = BAD (shows risk)**

## What You MUST Report on SF-86

### Section 21: Psychological & Emotional Health

**Question asked (exact wording):**
"In the last 7 years, have you consulted with a health care professional regarding an emotional or mental health condition or were you hospitalized for such a condition?"

**What to report:**
- ✅ YES if: Hospitalized (inpatient psychiatric care)
- ✅ YES if: Court-ordered treatment
- ✅ YES if: Diagnosed with serious condition (psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar, severe depression)

**What you DON'T have to report:**
- ❌ Marriage counseling
- ❌ Grief counseling (death in family)
- ❌ Strictly related to adjustments from service in a military combat environment
- ❌ Military OneSource counseling (short-term)
- ❌ Deployment stress counseling

**Note:** The question changed in 2016 to be MORE lenient (previously asked about ANY mental health consultation)

### How to Answer Honestly

**If YES, you provide:**
- Name of provider
- Dates of treatment
- Diagnosis (if given)
- Current status (still in treatment? condition controlled?)

**What they're looking for:**
- Are you being treated? (GOOD)
- Is condition improving? (GOOD)
- Are you compliant? (GOOD)

**Red flag answers:**
- "I was diagnosed but refuse treatment" (BAD - shows poor judgment)
- "I lied to get out of treatment" (BAD - dishonesty)
- "I hear voices telling me to..." (BAD - psychosis = security risk)

## Conditions That Usually DON'T Affect Clearance

### PTSD (Very Common in Military)

**Reality:**
- 10-20% of combat veterans have PTSD
- Many hold Top Secret clearances while treating PTSD

**What matters:**
- Are you in treatment? ✅
- Is it improving? ✅
- Can you still do your job? ✅

**If YES to all three:** Clearance is safe

**Example approved case:**
- Marine, Afghanistan veteran, PTSD diagnosis
- In therapy, taking medications
- Compliant with treatment
- Still deploys, still performs job
- **Top Secret clearance renewed**

### Depression & Anxiety

**Very common** (20%+ of military)

**Treatment:**
- Therapy (CBT, talk therapy)
- Medications (Zoloft, Lexapro, Prozac)

**Impact on clearance:**
- Usually NONE if condition is stable
- Medication compliance = GOOD (shows responsibility)

**Red flag:**
- Suicidal ideation (past is OK if treated, active = immediate security concern)
- Inability to work (can't perform duties)

### Medication (Antidepressants, Anti-Anxiety)

**Common misconception:** "Taking meds = lose clearance"

**Reality:** Thousands hold clearances while on:
- SSRIs (Zoloft, Lexapro, Prozac)
- SNRIs (Effexor, Cymbalta)
- Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Klonopin - if prescribed, not abused)

**What matters:**
- Prescribed by doctor ✅
- Taking as prescribed ✅
- Stable on medication ✅
- Can still perform duties ✅

**Red flag:**
- Abusing medications (taking more than prescribed)
- Mixing with alcohol
- Refusing prescribed medications

---

## Conditions That MAY Affect Clearance

### Psychosis (Schizophrenia, Severe Bipolar, Delusions)

**Why it matters:**
- Inability to distinguish reality = can't protect classified info
- Paranoia = potential security risk

**Can you keep clearance?**
- Maybe, if:
  - Controlled with medication
  - No recent psychotic episodes
  - Can perform duties
  - No hospitalization in past year

**Likely lose clearance if:**
- Active psychosis
- Refusing treatment
- Recent hospitalization for psychotic episode

### Hospitalization (Inpatient Psychiatric)

**Voluntary hospitalization:**
- Usually OK if:
  - You voluntarily sought help
  - You've been discharged and stable
  - You're compliant with aftercare

**Involuntary hospitalization:**
- Bigger red flag
- You were a danger to self/others
- May lose clearance (temporary or permanent)

**Mitigation:**
- Length of time since hospitalization
- Compliance with treatment since
- No repeat incidents

### Suicide Attempt

**Past attempt:**
- Will be investigated
- If long ago (5+ years) + stable since = usually OK

**Recent attempt (<2 years):**
- Red flag
- May suspend clearance pending treatment
- Can regain after demonstrating stability

**Current suicidal ideation:**
- Immediate security concern
- Clearance suspended
- Treatment required before reinstatement
