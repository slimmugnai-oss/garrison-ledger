# Security Clearance & Mental Health: What Disqualifies You (And What Doesn't)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Seeking mental health treatment does NOT automatically disqualify you from a security clearance. What DOES disqualify: Untreated conditions that impair judgment, refusal to seek help, lying about treatment history. Adjudicators care about CURRENT reliability, not past struggles. 90% of people who seek therapy keep their clearances.

## What Security Clearance Investigators Actually Look For

### The 13 Adjudicative Guidelines
**Only one relates to mental health:**
- **Guideline I: Psychological Conditions**

**The others:**
- Allegiance to US
- Foreign contacts
- Financial issues
- Criminal conduct
- Drug/alcohol use
- Personal conduct (lying, rule violations)
- Outside activities
- IT misuse

**Key insight:** Mental health is ONE factor among 13. Not automatic disqualification.

## Guideline I: Psychological Conditions (What Matters)

### What Investigators Care About:

**1. Current Impairment**
- Does condition currently affect judgment?
- Can you fulfill security responsibilities?
- Are you a risk to national security?

**2. Treatment Compliance**
- Are you following treatment plan?
- Taking prescribed medications?
- Attending therapy regularly?

**3. Prognosis**
- Is condition improving?
- What does mental health provider say?
- Evidence of stability?

**4. Honesty**
- Did you disclose condition on SF-86?
- Were you truthful in interview?
- Any attempts to hide treatment?

- If managed with therapy/medication, usually fine

**✅ PTSD - Does NOT automatically disqualify**
- Many combat veterans have PTSD + Top Secret clearances

## SF-86 Questions About Mental Health

### Section 21: Psychological and Emotional Health

**Question asks:**
> In the last 7 years, have you consulted with a health care professional regarding an emotional or mental health condition or were you hospitalized for such a condition?

**What to include:**
- Inpatient psychiatric hospitalization
- Outpatient therapy (if specifically for mental health diagnosis)
- Evaluations for mental health conditions

**What you DON'T need to include:**
- Marriage counseling (not mental health diagnosis)
- Grief counseling (not a disorder)
- Stress management workshops
- Career counseling
- Strictly related to substance abuse (covered in different section)

### How to Answer Honestly

**Example (Good Answer):**
> "Yes. I sought treatment for depression following deployment in 2022. I attended 12 sessions of therapy with Dr. Smith at Fort Bragg Mental Health Clinic. I was prescribed Zoloft 50mg. Condition is now stable. I have been symptom-free for 18 months."

**Example (Bad Answer):**
> "No." (When you actually did seek treatment) ← This is lying. Automatic disqualification.

**Example (Bad Answer):**
> "Yes, but I refuse to provide details." ← Looks like you're hiding something.

## The Clearance Process (What Happens)

### Step 1: Submit SF-86
- Answer all questions honestly
- Disclose mental health treatment (if within 7 years)

### Step 2: Background Investigation
- Investigator may contact mental health provider
- Provider releases LIMITED info (dates of treatment, diagnosis, prognosis)
- Full therapy notes are NOT released (HIPAA protections)

### Step 3: Interview (If Needed)
- Investigator asks follow-up questions
- "Are you still in treatment?"
- "How is your condition now?"
- "Are you compliant with medication?"

### Step 4: Adjudication
- Adjudicator reviews all info
- Weighs mental health against other factors
- Makes decision: Grant, Deny, or Further Investigation

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: PTSD + Top Secret Clearance (APPROVED)
**Situation:**
- Combat veteran, Iraq deployment
- Diagnosed with PTSD in 2021
- Attended therapy, took Prazosin for nightmares
- Disclosed everything on SF-86

**Outcome:**
- Granted Top Secret clearance
- Investigator noted: "Applicant sought appropriate treatment. Currently stable. Prognosis good."

### Example 2: Depression, Lied on SF-86 (DENIED)
**Situation:**
- Service member had depression, saw therapist in 2020
- On SF-86, answered "No" to mental health question
- Investigator found out (checked medical records)

**Outcome:**
- Clearance denied for "Personal Conduct" (lying), NOT for depression
- If they had been honest, likely would have been approved

### Example 3: Untreated Bipolar Disorder (DENIED)
**Situation:**
- Service member diagnosed with bipolar disorder
- Refused medication, stopped therapy
- Erratic behavior at work, multiple incidents

**Outcome:**
- Clearance denied
- Reason: Untreated condition impairing judgment and reliability

### Example 4: Anxiety, Fully Treated (APPROVED)
**Situation:**
- Service member developed anxiety after PCS
- Saw therapist for 6 months, took Zoloft
- Disclosed on SF-86, provided details

**Outcome:**
- Clearance granted (no delay)
- Investigator: "Applicant responsibly managed condition. No current impairment."

## Common Questions

### Q: Will my therapist's notes be reviewed?
**A:** No. Investigator can only access summary info (dates, diagnosis, prognosis). Full notes are protected by HIPAA.

### Q: Can I get interim clearance while seeking mental health treatment?
**A:** Yes, if treatment is for minor/common condition (depression, anxiety) and you're stable.

### Q: What if I was involuntarily hospitalized (5150/psych hold)?
**A:** You MUST disclose. Recent (within 1-2 years) = likely denial or delay. Older (3+ years ago) + stable now = may be approved.

### Q: Do I need a letter from my therapist?
**A:** It can help. A letter stating "Patient is stable, compliant with treatment, prognosis is good" strengthens your case.

### Q: Will seeking help now hurt my future clearance application?
**A:** No. Seeking help NOW shows good judgment. NOT seeking help and having crisis later is much worse.
