# Military Emergency Fund: How Much Do You Really Need?

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Most military members need a SMALLER emergency fund than civilians (3 months vs. 6-12 months) due to job security, free healthcare, and guaranteed housing. Save $5,000-$10,000 as a starting goal, then build to 3-6 months of expenses based on your situation.

## Why Military Emergency Funds Are Different

### Job Security
- You can't be "laid off" mid-contract
- Steady paychecks every 1st and 15th
- No seasonal income fluctuations

### Free/Subsidized Benefits
- Free healthcare (TRICARE)
- Housing allowance (BAH) or free on-base housing
- No insurance deductibles for most medical care

### Access to Low-Cost Credit
- Navy Federal/USAA emergency loans at low rates
- Military relief societies (AER, NMCRS, AFAS, CGMLA)
- TSP loans at prime rate

**Result:** You need LESS cash sitting idle than civilians.

## Where to Keep Your Emergency Fund

### Best Options (In Order):

**1. High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA)**
- Navy Federal Savings (currently 4.25% APY)
- USAA Performance Savings (currently 4.0% APY)
- Marcus by Goldman Sachs (currently 4.5% APY)
- Ally Bank (currently 4.3% APY)

**Why:** Earns interest, FDIC insured, accessible in 1-2 days

**2. Money Market Fund**
- Vanguard Federal Money Market (VMFXX)
- Fidelity Government Money Market (SPAXX)

**Why:** Slightly higher rates than savings, same-day access

**3. TSP G Fund (If You Have TSP Already)**
- Guaranteed 2-3% return
- No risk of loss
- Accessible via TSP loan in emergency

**Why:** Already set up, safe, but slower access (5-7 days for withdrawal)

### AVOID for Emergency Funds:
- ❌ Checking accounts (0% interest)
- ❌ Stock market (can drop 30-50% when you need it)
- ❌ CDs (early withdrawal penalties)
- ❌ Crypto (extremely volatile, not liquid)

## Action Plan

**Step 1: Calculate Your Target**
- Monthly expenses: $______
- Multiply by 3 (for 3-month fund): $______
- Adjust based on tier above

**Step 2: Open HYSA**
- Navy Federal or USAA (if eligible)
- Or Ally/Marcus (available to all)
- Set up automatic transfers

**Step 3: Automate Savings**
- Set up $200-$500/month auto-transfer
- Treat it like a bill
- Don't touch unless true emergency

**Step 4: Invest the Rest**
