# PCS Final Out & Clearing: Complete Checklist to Avoid Paying Thousands

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Final out/clearing = Official departure from base (return equipment, close accounts, get signatures). Must clear 15-25 offices (housing, supply, finance, medical, etc.) before final signature. Missing items = pay statement charges ($500-$5,000 for lost gear). Housing damage = security deposit loss + repair charges ($1,000-$10,000). Timeline: Start 30 days before PCS, finish by final out date. Most common charges: Lost gear (TA-50, CIF), housing damage (wall holes, carpet stains, broken appliances), unreturned library books, unpaid gym fees. Bring DA Form 31 (leave form) or clearing papers to each office for signatures.

## What Is Final Out/Clearing?

### Purpose

**Official checkout from base:**
- Return all issued equipment
- Close all base accounts
- Settle debts
- Get clearance signatures
- Receive final orders endorsement

**Consequences of incomplete clearing:**
- Hold on orders (can't PCS until cleared)
- Pay statement charges (thousands of dollars for lost equipment)
- Delayed travel payment
- Bad reputation (next unit hears you left issues)

### Who Must Clear

**Required:**
- ✅ PCS to new duty station
- ✅ Separation/retirement
- ✅ Deployment (sometimes - partial clearing)

**Not required:**
- TDY (temporary duty)
- Leave (vacation)

## Appeal Process (If You Disagree with Charges)

### Disputing Housing Charges

**If you believe charges are unfair:**

**Step 1: Request re-inspection**
- Document issue (photos)
- Show: Damage was pre-existing OR repairs were done

**Step 2: File formal dispute**
- Written statement to housing office
- Include: Photos, receipts (if you repaired), proof of pre-existing damage

**Step 3: Commander involvement (if needed)**
- Request commander review dispute
- Sometimes charges waived if commander intervenes

**Timeline:** 30-60 days for resolution

**Reality:** Most charges stick (burden of proof is on you)

### Disputing Lost Gear Charges

**If you believe gear was returned:**

**Step 1: Check supply records**
- Request printout (what they say you didn't return)
- Show: You DID return (maybe lost in system)

**Step 2: Get buddy statement**
- Someone who saw you return gear
- Written statement: "I was present when SPC Smith returned helmet on [date]"

**Step 3: File dispute**
- Submit to supply sergeant + commander

**Rarely successful unless:**
- Clear evidence you returned gear
- Supply lost it (their error, not yours)
