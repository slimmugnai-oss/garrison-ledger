# Substance Abuse in Military: When to Get Help & Treatment Options

**Bottom Line Up Front:** 11-20% of service members struggle with substance abuse (vs. 8% general population). Most common: Alcohol (binge drinking culture), prescription painkillers (over-prescribed for injuries), stimulants (to stay awake on duty). Signs: Drinking alone, needing alcohol daily, job performance decline, DUI, relationship problems. Free confidential help: SUDCC (Substance Use Disorder Clinical Care) on every base, Military OneSource (24/7), TRICARE covers rehab. Consequences: Article 15, discharge, loss of security clearance, VA benefits at risk. Early treatment = career saved. Waiting until crisis = career destroyed.

## Substance Abuse in Military (The Reality)

### Why Military Rates Are Higher

**Unique stressors:**
- Combat trauma (PTSD, anxiety → self-medication)
- Physical pain (injuries → painkiller dependence)
- Deployment stress (alcohol = coping mechanism)
- Frequent moves (uprooting → instability → drinking)
- High-pressure ops (stimulants to stay alert)

**Cultural factors:**
- Drinking culture (barracks parties, unit events)
- "Suck it up" mentality (don't seek help, drink instead)
- Easy access (cheap alcohol on base, prescription pills from clinic)

**Statistics:**
- 20% of service members binge drink monthly (vs. 12% civilians)
- 1 in 10 military prescribed opioid painkillers (injury rates)
- 11% meet criteria for substance use disorder

4. Have you had legal issues (DUI, disorderly conduct)? (YES = problem)

## Command-Directed vs. Voluntary Treatment

### Voluntary Treatment (You Self-Refer)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Mostly confidential (commander may not be told)
- ✅ No automatic punishment (seeking help ≠ automatic Article 15)
- ✅ Shows initiative (commanders appreciate self-awareness)

**How to do it:**
- Call SUDCC directly
- Schedule assessment
- Attend treatment
- Commander MAY be notified eventually (if treatment is intensive), but you get credit for self-referring

**Consequences:**
- Usually minimal if you self-refer BEFORE getting caught (DUI, failed drug test)

### Command-Directed Treatment

**When it happens:**
- After DUI
- After failed drug test (alcohol incident, not marijuana)
- After alcohol-related incident (fight, misconduct)
- Commander suspects problem

**Process:**
1. Commander orders you to SUDCC
2. You attend assessment (not optional)
3. Treatment plan created
4. You MUST complete treatment

**Consequences:**
- Commander fully informed
- May receive Article 15 (for incident that triggered referral)
- Treatment completion = condition of keeping job
- Failure to complete = discharge possible

**Difference from voluntary:**
- Voluntary = you chose to get help → less punishment
- Command-directed = you got caught → punishment likely
