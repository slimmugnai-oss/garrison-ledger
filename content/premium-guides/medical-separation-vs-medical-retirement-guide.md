# Medical Separation vs. Medical Retirement: Complete Guide (MEB/PEB Process)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) determines if you're fit for duty. Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) assigns disability rating. <30% rating = Medical Separation (severance pay, no pension). 30%+ rating = Medical Retirement (immediate pension). VA disability rating is separate - file VA claim before separating. Most get higher VA rating than DoD rating.

## MEB/PEB Process Overview

### Medical Evaluation Board (MEB)
**Purpose:** Determines if your condition prevents you from performing military duties

**Questions MEB answers:**
- Can you deploy?
- Can you perform physical requirements of your job?
- Is condition stable or improving?

**Outcome:** Fit for duty OR Refer to PEB

### Physical Evaluation Board (PEB)
**Purpose:** If MEB says unfit, PEB assigns disability percentage and determines separation type

**PEB assigns:**
- Disability rating (0%-100%)
- Separation type (medical separation vs. retirement)
- Severance pay amount OR retirement pay amount

## Medical Separation (<30% Rating)

### What It Is
**You're separated from military with severance pay (lump sum), but NO military pension**

### Requirements
- Disability rating: <30% (0%-20%)
- Condition prevents military service
- But not severe enough for retirement

### Severance Pay Formula

```
Severance = Years of Service × 2 × Monthly Base Pay
```

**Maximum:** 12 years of service counted (capped)

**Example: E-5 with 8 years service**
- Base pay: $3,500/month
- Severance: 8 × 2 × $3,500 = **$56,000**
- Paid as lump sum (taxable)

**Example: O-3 with 10 years service**
- Base pay: $6,500/month
- Severance: 10 × 2 × $6,500 = **$130,000**

### What You Get
- ✅ Severance pay (lump sum)
- ✅ Transition health coverage (180 days TRICARE)
- ✅ Can apply for VA disability
- ❌ NO military pension
- ❌ NO TRICARE for life
- ❌ NO commissary/exchange after 180 days

### Severance Recoupment (MUST PAY BACK)

**Critical rule:** If you receive VA disability, you must PAY BACK severance

**How it works:**
- VA withholds future VA disability payments
- Until full severance amount is recouped

**Example:**
- You received $56,000 severance
- VA awards 50% disability: $1,075/month
- VA withholds payments until $56,000 recouped
- Takes 52 months (4.3 years) before you see VA payments

**After recoupment:** Full VA disability payments resume

## Medical Retirement (30%+ Rating)

### What It Is
**Immediate military pension, TRICARE for life, full retirement benefits**

### Requirements
- Disability rating: 30%+ (from PEB)
- OR 20+ years of service (regardless of rating)

### Retirement Pay Options

**Option 1: Disability Retirement**
- Based on disability percentage
- Formula: `Base Pay × Disability % × 2.5`

**Option 2: Longevity Retirement (if 20+ years)**
- Based on years of service
- Formula: `Base Pay × Years × 2.5%`

**You receive HIGHER of the two**

### Example: E-7 with 15 years, 50% Disability

**Option 1 (Disability):**
- Base pay: $5,000/month
- 50% × 2.5 = 125% of base pay × 50% rating
- Retirement: $2,500/month

**Option 2 (Longevity):**
- 15 years × 2.5% = 37.5%
- $5,000 × 37.5% = $1,875/month

**You get: $2,500/month (higher amount)**

### What You Get
- ✅ Immediate pension for life
- ✅ TRICARE for life (retired military)
- ✅ Commissary/Exchange for life
- ✅ VA disability (can receive BOTH)
- ✅ Space-A travel
- ✅ All retirement benefits

### CRDP (Concurrent Retirement & Disability Pay)

**If rated 50%+ VA disability:**
- Can receive BOTH military retirement AND full VA disability
- No offset (used to be dollar-for-dollar reduction)

**Example: E-7 medically retired, 60% VA**
- Military retirement: $2,600/month
- VA disability: $1,361/month
- **Total: $3,961/month**

## DoD Rating vs. VA Rating (CRITICAL DIFFERENCE)

### DoD (PEB) Rating
- Based on: Fitness for MILITARY duty
- Question: Can you serve in military with this condition?
- Usually LOWER rating

### VA Rating
- Based on: Impact on CIVILIAN employment and quality of life
- Question: How disabled are you in civilian life?
- Usually HIGHER rating

### Example: Knee Injury

**DoD PEB:** 10% (can walk, can work, just can't run/ruck in military)  
**VA:** 30% (chronic pain, limits civilian work, affects daily activities)

**Result:**
- Medical separation (10% DoD)
- Severance: $56,000
- But VA awards 30%: $524/month for life
- Must repay severance (takes 107 months)
- After recoupment: Receive full VA for life

## The MEB/PEB Process (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Medical Condition Identified
- Diagnosed with condition that limits duty performance
- Provider says: "You may be non-deployable" or "Can't perform full duties"
- Provider initiates MEB referral

### Step 2: MEB Review (2-3 Months)
- Medical records reviewed
- Specialists evaluate you
- MEB decides: Fit for duty OR unfit (refer to PEB)

**If fit for duty:** Return to unit  
**If unfit:** Move to PEB

### Step 3: Informal PEB (IPEB)
- Board reviews medical evidence
- Assigns disability rating
- Recommends: Separation OR Retirement

**You can:**
- Accept findings (move to separation/retirement)
- Request Formal PEB (if you disagree)

### Step 4: Formal PEB (If Requested)
- In-person hearing (like court)
- You can bring lawyer (free military attorney or paid civilian)
- Present evidence, witnesses
- Board reconsiders rating

### Step 5: Final Decision
- PEB issues final rating
- You have 10 days to appeal to Secretary of Service
- If no appeal: Separation/retirement proceeds

### Step 6: VA Claim Filing (CRITICAL)
**File VA claim BEFORE separating**
- BDD (Benefits Delivery at Discharge) program
- Allows VA to process claim while you're still active
- Results in VA rating within 60-90 days of separation

**Timeline:**
- File: 90-180 days before separation
- Attend C&P exam
- VA rating issued near separation date
- Start receiving VA payments immediately after separation

## Common MEB/PEB Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Getting Civilian Lawyer for Formal PEB
**Reality:** Military lawyer is free but may not be aggressive. You get 10% rating instead of 30%. Lose retirement.

**Fix:** Hire experienced PEB lawyer ($2,000-$5,000) if your case is borderline 30%. Can be difference between separation and retirement.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Filing VA Claim via BDD
**Reality:** You separate. File VA claim after. Takes 6-12 months. No income during that time.

**Fix:** File BDD claim 90-180 days before separation. Get VA rating immediately.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Accepting IPEB Without Review
**Reality:** IPEB gives you 20%. You accept. Later realize evidence supported 30%+. Too late to appeal.

**Fix:** Review findings with lawyer BEFORE accepting. If borderline, request Formal PEB.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Spending Severance Pay Immediately
**Reality:** You get $60,000 severance. Buy truck, take vacation. VA recoupment starts. Now you owe $60,000 back with no cash.

**Fix:** Save severance in HYSA. Don't touch it until you know your VA rating.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Understanding Severance Recoupment
**Reality:** You think severance is "free money." Get VA disability. Confused why you're not receiving payments.

**Fix:** Know the rule: VA withholds until severance recouped. Plan accordingly.
