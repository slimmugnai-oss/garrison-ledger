## Keywords Strategy (Get Found by Recruiters)

### How Recruiters Search LinkedIn

**They search for:**
1. Job title ("Operations Manager")
2. Skills ("Supply Chain" + "Logistics")
3. Location ("Washington DC")
4. Clearance ("Secret")

**If you don't have these keywords, you don't show up in search results.**

### Where to Put Keywords

**Include target keywords in:**
- ✅ Headline
- ✅ About section (3-5 times)
- ✅ Experience descriptions
- ✅ Skills section
- ✅ Job titles (civilian translations)

**Example: Targeting "Project Manager" roles**

**Headline:** Project Manager | PMP Certified | IT Implementation | Risk Management  
**About:** "I'm a project manager with 8 years of experience... As a project manager in the military, I led projects ranging from..."  
**Experience:** "Project Manager (Operations Officer Equivalent)"  
**Skills:** Project Management, Agile, Scrum, Risk Management, Stakeholder Communication

**Result:** When recruiter searches "Project Manager" + your city, you appear in results.

## LinkedIn Activity Strategy

### 1. Build Network (50+ Connections Minimum)

**Who to connect with:**
- Former military colleagues
- College classmates
- Veterans in your target industry
- Recruiters (search "Recruiter + [Your Industry]")
- Hiring managers at companies you're interested in

**Connection request template:**
```
Hi [Name], I'm a transitioning Army veteran moving into [industry]. I saw your background in [their experience] and would love to connect and learn from your experience. Thanks!
```

### 2. Engage with Content (15 Minutes/Day)

## Common LinkedIn Mistakes for Veterans

### ❌ Mistake #1: Profile Photo in Uniform
**Reality:** Civilian recruiters don't relate. You look unapproachable.

**Fix:** Professional headshot in business casual. Save uniform photo for "About" section story.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Headline = Military Rank/MOS
**Reality:** "Staff Sergeant, 11B Infantryman" = recruiters skip you (don't understand what you do).

**Fix:** Civilian job title + skills. "Operations Manager | Team Leadership | Process Improvement"

### ❌ Mistake #3: No Civilian Translation of Experience
**Reality:** Your experience says "Led fire team, conducted patrols, executed CONOPS." Recruiter: "What does that mean?"

**Fix:** Translate EVERYTHING. "Led team of 4, managed security operations, implemented operational plans."

### ❌ Mistake #4: <50 Connections
**Reality:** You have 12 connections. Recruiters think you're not serious about job search.

**Fix:** Connect with 50-100 people in first month. Former colleagues, veterans, recruiters.

### ❌ Mistake #5: No Activity (Ghost Profile)
**Reality:** You created profile 6 months ago. Haven't posted, liked, or commented since.

**Fix:** Engage 15 min/day. Like posts, comment, share. LinkedIn rewards activity.
