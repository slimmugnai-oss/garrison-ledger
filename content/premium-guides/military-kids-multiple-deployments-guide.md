# Military Kids & Multiple Deployments: Supporting Children Through Repeated Separations

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Multiple deployments harder than first deployment. Kids: Cumulative stress (first deployment = scary, second = "not again", third = anger/withdrawal). Resilience factors: Strong at-home parent, routine maintenance, peer support (other military kids), therapy when needed. Warning signs: Grades decline across deployments, behavioral escalation, "I don't care anymore" attitude. Free support: Military OneSource (counseling for kids), school counselor, FOCUS (Families OverComing Under Stress program), Kids Rank, Our Military Kids. Reintegration: Harder after each deployment (kids guard emotions, fear parent will leave again). Parent must be patient, consistent, rebuild trust slowly.

## How Multiple Deployments Affect Kids

### First Deployment (Learning Phase)

**What kids experience:**
- Sadness, worry, fear
- Behavior changes (acting out, clinginess)
- But: Usually bounce back within 2-3 months of homecoming

**Why it's different:**
- New experience (don't know what to expect)
- Still trust parent will come home
- Novelty (countdown calendar, letters, care packages = exciting)

### Second Deployment (Harder)

**What kids experience:**
- Anger ("Why are you leaving AGAIN?")
- Resentment ("You chose military over us")
- Less engagement (don't send letters, avoid video calls)
- Worry intensifies (first deployment = parent came home, but fear "what if this time they don't?")

**Why it's harder:**
- They know how hard deployment is now
- Lost trust ("You said you'd be home, now you're leaving again")
- Cumulative stress (haven't fully recovered from first deployment)

### Third+ Deployments (Breaking Point for Some)

**What kids experience:**
- Emotional shutdown ("I don't care anymore, protect myself")
- Behavioral escalation (serious acting out, substance use in teens)
- Academic decline (grades tank, stop trying)
- Detachment from deploying parent ("Why should I bond with someone who always leaves?")

**Warning signs:**
- "I don't care if you deploy" (emotional protection, not truth)
- Refuse to communicate during deployment
- Act like parent doesn't exist

**When to get help:**
- Immediately if behavioral changes significant
- Don't wait for crisis

## Supporting Kids Through Multiple Deployments

### What NOT to Do

**Don't minimize:**
- ❌ "You've done this before, you'll be fine"
- ✅ "I know this is hard. It's OK to be upset."

**Don't compare:**
- ❌ "Your friend's dad has deployed 5 times, you've only done 2"
- ✅ "This is hard for YOU, and that's what matters"

**Don't expect resilience without support:**
- ❌ "Military kids are tough, they'll handle it"
- ✅ "Military kids need EXTRA support because they face more than civilian kids"

### What TO Do

**Acknowledge cumulative stress:**
- "I know this is your 3rd deployment. Each one is hard. I'm sorry."

**Validate feelings:**
- Anger, resentment, fear = all valid
- Don't punish emotions ("Don't be mad at Daddy for deploying!")
- Address behavior (not feelings)

**Routine + stability:**
- Keep same schedule (bedtime, meals, school, activities)
- Don't let deployment disrupt normal life
- Predictability = safety

**Therapy:**
- Multiple deployments = therapy recommended (not optional)
- Helps process feelings in safe space
- Prevents long-term issues (depression, anxiety, PTSD in kids)

## Reintegration After Multiple Deployments

### First Deployment Homecoming

**Honeymoon phase:**
- Excitement, relief, joy
- "Daddy's home forever!" (kids think)

**Adjustment:**
- 2-6 months to reintegrate
- But kids bounce back relatively quickly

### Second+ Deployment Homecoming

**Guarded emotions:**
- Kids don't fully celebrate ("He'll just leave again")
- Protect hearts (don't get too attached)
- Take longer to warm up (weeks vs. days)

**Regaining trust:**
- Kids: "You said you wouldn't leave, then you deployed again. Why should I believe you now?"
- Parent must rebuild trust (consistency, presence, time)

**How deployed parent can help:**
- Be patient (don't force bonding)
- Consistent presence (show up to games, school, activities)
- One-on-one time (individual dates with each kid)
- Apologize if needed ("I'm sorry I missed your birthday. I know that hurt.")

### "I Don't Want to Get Attached" (Kids' Perspective)

**What kids think:**
- "If I love Daddy, and he deploys again, it'll hurt too much"
- "Easier to not care"

**How it manifests:**
- Ignoring parent
- Refusing affection
- "I don't care if you're home"

**Parent response:**
- Don't take it personally (it's self-protection, not rejection)
- Consistent love (even if kid doesn't reciprocate)
- Time (healing takes months/years)

## When Multiple Deployments Warrant Career Change

### Is It Time to Get Out?

**Signs military career is destroying family:**
- Marriage falling apart (spouse threatens divorce)
- Kids in crisis (serious behavioral issues, depression, failing school)
- You're missing everything (every birthday, every milestone)
- Resentment building (kids hate the military, hate you)

**Options:**
- Request non-deployable assignment (recruiting, training, staff)
- Switch to Reserves/National Guard (less frequent deployments)
- Separate from military (choose family over career)

**Hard truth:**
- Some jobs = frequent deployments (infantry, special ops, Navy ships)
- If family can't handle it → something has to change

**Decision factors:**
- Years until retirement (15 years in = stay for pension?)
- Financial impact (can you afford to get out?)
- Family wellbeing (what's best for kids?)

### Non-Deployable Assignments (If Staying In)

**Request:**
- Recruiting duty (2-3 years, no deployment)
- Training instructor (teach at base, no deployment)
- Staff assignment (Pentagon, headquarters)

**Trade-offs:**
- Career progression slower (non-deployable = less competitive for promotion)
- May not get preferred assignment
- But: Family stability

## Action Steps

### Before Each Deployment:
1. ✅ Family meeting (tell kids 2-4 weeks before)
2. ✅ Acknowledge this is hard ("I know this is deployment #3, I'm sorry")
3. ✅ Create visual countdown (even if they've done before)
4. ✅ Set communication plan

### During Deployment:
1. ✅ Maintain routine (same rules, bedtime, expectations)
2. ✅ Watch for warning signs (grades, behavior, mood)
3. ✅ Therapy if needed (Military OneSource, school counselor)
4. ✅ Connect with other deployment families (FRG, school groups)

### After Deployment:
1. ✅ Reintegration time (2-6 months, longer for repeat deployments)
2. ✅ One-on-one time with each kid (rebuild bond)
3. ✅ Family therapy if struggling (FOCUS, Military OneSource)
4. ✅ Consistent presence (show up, be reliable)

### If Kids Are in Crisis:
1. ✅ Immediate help (Military OneSource, TRICARE mental health)
2. ✅ Consider: Is it time to request non-deployable assignment?
3. ✅ Family counseling (all together + kids individually)

**Remember:** Multiple deployments take cumulative toll on kids (first = hard, second = harder, third+ = potential crisis). Each deployment requires FULL support cycle (prep, communication during, reintegration after). Warning signs: Behavioral escalation, emotional shutdown, academic decline. Free resources available (Military OneSource, FOCUS, school counselor). Reintegration harder each time (kids guard emotions). Parent must be patient, consistent, rebuild trust. Consider: At what point is career not worth family damage? Some choose non-deployable assignments or separate from military. Your kids' wellbeing matters.
