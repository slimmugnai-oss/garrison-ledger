# GI Bill Comparison 2025: Post-9/11 vs. Montgomery vs. Transfer (Complete Decision Guide)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Post-9/11 GI Bill is better for 95% of service members. It covers full tuition + housing + books at public universities. Montgomery GI Bill only makes sense if you're attending a very cheap school and want cash payments. Transferring to dependents requires 6+ years of additional service commitment.

## The Three GI Bills Compared

| **Housing allowance** | E-5 BAH rate for school ZIP | $0 | Reduced (if service member is active duty) |
| **Books/supplies** | $1,000/year | $0 | $1,000/year |
| **Best for** | Traditional college | Very cheap schools, vocational training | Spouse or kids going to college |
| **Service requirement** | 90 days (post-9/11) or 36 months | 36 months active duty | 6 years (4 years to transfer + 4 more to serve) |
| **Cost to you** | $0 | $1,200 buy-in | $0 |

## The Big Decision: Post-9/11 vs. MGIB

### Use Post-9/11 If:
- ✅ Attending traditional 4-year university
- ✅ School costs $20,000+/year
- ✅ Going to school in expensive city (high MHA)
- ✅ Want to live like a normal student (housing allowance helps)

### Use MGIB If:
- ✅ Attending very cheap school (<$5,000/year)
- ✅ Doing online-only program
- ✅ Want cash in hand (not just tuition coverage)
- ✅ Attending vocational/trade school

### Use Transfer If:

## How to Switch Between GI Bills

**You CAN switch from MGIB to Post-9/11:**
- Go to VA.gov
- Submit VA Form 22-1990
- Forgo MGIB benefits
- **NOTE:** You do NOT get your $1,200 MGIB contribution back

**You CANNOT switch from Post-9/11 to MGIB:**

**Strategy:**
- If you're unsure, keep MGIB active until you enroll
- Switch to Post-9/11 when you start school

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Transferring Before Separation
**Reality:** You can't transfer GI Bill AFTER you leave the military.

**Fix:** If you think your spouse/kids might use it, transfer NOW (even if they don't use it immediately).

### ❌ Mistake #2: Wasting Post-9/11 on Cheap Schools
**Reality:** Using full GI Bill on a $2,000/year community college wastes housing allowance.

**Fix:** Use Pell Grant + TA for cheap schools. Save GI Bill for expensive bachelor's/master's.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Using Yellow Ribbon Schools
**Reality:** You pay $30,000/year at private school when Yellow Ribbon would make it $0.

**Fix:** Check VA.gov/yellow-ribbon-schools before enrolling.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Going to School Full-Time Too Fast
**Reality:** You burn through 36 months in 3 years and can't finish master's.

**Fix:** Use Tuition Assistance (TA) for first 2 years, GI Bill for last 2 years + master's.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Applying Before Benefits Expire
**Reality:** Post-9/11 GI Bill expires 15 years after separation.

**Fix:** Apply for VA education benefits even if not enrolling yet (stops expiration clock).
