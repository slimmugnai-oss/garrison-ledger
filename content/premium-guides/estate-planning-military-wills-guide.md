# Estate Planning for Military: Wills, Trusts & Beneficiaries Complete Guide

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Free will preparation at JAG office on every base. Minimum estate plan: Will + Power of Attorney + Healthcare Directive. Update after major life events (marriage, kids, divorce). Beneficiaries override will for TSP, SGLI, retirement (check annually). Most service members need simple will ($0 at JAG) not expensive trust ($2,000-$5,000). Without will, state decides who gets assets (often not what you want).

## Why Military Members Need Estate Plans

### Deployment Risk
- Combat deployments increase mortality risk
- Need plan in case worst happens
- Without will: State law determines asset distribution (may not match wishes)

### Frequent Life Changes
- Marriage, kids, divorce, remarriage = beneficiaries change
- PCS every 2-3 years = state laws change
- Need to update regularly

### Complex Assets
- TSP, SGLI, military retirement, VA disability, real estate
- Different rules for each
- Need coordination

## The 3 Essential Estate Planning Documents

### 1. Last Will and Testament

**What it covers:**
- Who gets your property (house, car, personal items)
- Guardian for minor children
- Executor (person who manages estate)
- Distribution of assets

**What it DOESN'T cover:**
- TSP (has separate beneficiary)
- SGLI (has separate beneficiary)
- Retirement pay (has separate beneficiary)
- Jointly-owned property (goes to joint owner automatically)

**Cost:**
- **JAG office: FREE** (available on every base)
- **Civilian lawyer: $500-$2,000**
- **Online (LegalZoom): $100-$300**

**Recommendation:** Use JAG (free, familiar with military)

### 2. Power of Attorney (Financial)

**What it does:**
- Gives someone authority to manage finances if you're incapacitated
- Especially important during deployments

**Types:**
- **Durable:** Remains valid if you're incapacitated
- **Springing:** Only activates if you're incapacitated

**Who to appoint:**
- Usually spouse
- Backup: Parent or sibling
- Must be trustworthy (has access to ALL your finances)

**Get at:** JAG office (free)

### 3. Healthcare Directive (Medical POA)

**What it does:**
- Allows someone to make medical decisions if you can't
- End-of-life preferences
- Organ donation wishes

**Who to appoint:**
- Usually spouse
- Backup: Parent
- NOT same person as financial POA if they're also beneficiary (conflict of interest)

**Get at:** JAG office (free) or state-specific form online

## Beneficiary Designations (CRITICAL)

### Beneficiaries OVERRIDE Your Will

**Assets with separate beneficiaries:**
1. **TSP (Thrift Savings Plan)**
2. **SGLI (Life Insurance)**
3. **Military Retirement**
4. **IRAs, 401(k)s**
5. **Bank accounts (if "Payable on Death" designated)**

**Example problem:**
- Your will says: "Everything to my spouse"
- Your SGLI beneficiary: Ex-girlfriend (you forgot to update)
- **Your ex gets $500,000. Spouse gets $0.**

**Fix:** Update beneficiaries separately for each asset

### Where to Update Beneficiaries

**TSP:**
- Log into TSP.gov
- Go to "Beneficiaries"
- Update and save

**SGLI:**
- Log into myPay
- Go to SGLI section
- Update beneficiary

**Military Retirement:**
- DFAS website
- SBP (Survivor Benefit Plan) election

**Bank accounts:**
- Call bank or visit branch
- Add "Payable on Death" (POD) beneficiary

### When to Update Beneficiaries

**Update within 1 week of:**
- Marriage
- Divorce
- Birth of child
- Death of beneficiary
- Estrangement from family

**Review annually** (set calendar reminder)

## Do You Need a Trust? (Probably Not)

### When You DON'T Need a Trust (95% of Military)

**Simple will is sufficient if:**
- ✅ Estate value <$1M
- ✅ No complex family situation (no disabled dependents, no contentious ex-spouses)
- ✅ Straightforward wishes ("Everything to spouse, then kids")
- ✅ Minor kids (will appoints guardian, trust not needed)

**Cost of trust:** $2,000-$5,000  
**Cost of will:** $0 (JAG) to $500 (civilian lawyer)

**Verdict:** Save money, use simple will

### When You DO Need a Trust (5% of Military)

**Trust is beneficial if:**
- ✅ Estate value >$1M (trust avoids probate)
- ✅ Disabled child (special needs trust protects government benefits)
- ✅ Blended family (trust ensures kids from first marriage get inheritance)
- ✅ Own rental properties (trust simplifies management)
- ✅ Want to avoid probate (trust assets transfer immediately, will goes through probate = 6-12 months)

**Types of trusts:**
- **Revocable living trust:** You control during life, avoids probate after death
- **Irrevocable trust:** Can't change, but protects assets from creditors
- **Special needs trust:** For disabled dependents

### Married with Kids (Age 30-45)

**Essential plan:**

## Common Estate Planning Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: No Will ("I Don't Have Enough Assets")

**Reality:** You die without will. State law decides distribution. May not match your wishes.

**State law typically gives:**
- Spouse gets 50%, parents get 50% (if no kids)
- Kids get everything, spouse gets nothing (in some states)
- Parents get everything if you're single

**Fix:** Get will at JAG. FREE. Takes 30 minutes.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Forgetting to Update Beneficiaries

**Reality:** You marry, have kids, get promoted. SGLI still lists ex-girlfriend. You die. She gets $500,000.

**Fix:** Update beneficiaries after EVERY major life event.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Appointing Guardian for Kids

**Reality:** You and spouse die. No guardian named. Court decides who raises your kids. May pick person you wouldn't want.

**Fix:** Name guardian in will. Discuss with chosen guardian first.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Buying Expensive Whole Life Insurance Instead of Simple Term + Will

**Reality:** Agent sells you $500/month whole life "for estate planning." You could get same coverage with $50/month term + free will at JAG.

**Fix:** Term life + will = Better and cheaper. Invest the $450/month difference in TSP.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Coordinating Beneficiaries

**Reality:**
- Will says: "Split evenly between 3 kids"
- TSP says: "100% to Kid #1"
- SGLI says: "100% to spouse"
- Distribution is messy, not what you intended

**Fix:** Ensure all beneficiary designations align with overall wishes.

## Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) for Retirees

### What Is SBP?

**Military retirement survivor benefit**
- Ensures spouse gets portion of your retirement pay after you die
- Cost: 6.5% of retirement pay (deducted from your pension)

**Example:**
- Retirement pay: $3,000/month
- SBP cost: $195/month (6.5%)
- You receive: $2,805/month
- **If you die: Spouse gets 55% of retirement = $1,650/month for life**

### SBP vs. Life Insurance

**SBP pros:**
- Inflation-adjusted (COLA increases)
- Guaranteed for spouse's lifetime
- Can't be canceled (vs. term life that expires)

**SBP cons:**
- Expensive (6.5% of pension for life)
- Only covers spouse (doesn't help kids)

**Life insurance pros:**
- Cheaper (term life = $100/month vs. $195/month SBP)
- Lump sum (spouse can invest $500K, earn more than $1,650/month)
- Flexible

**Which is better:**
- SBP: If spouse is bad with money (guaranteed monthly income)
- Life insurance: If spouse can manage lump sum (more financial flexibility)

**Many choose:** SBP + life insurance (double protection)
