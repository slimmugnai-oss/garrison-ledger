# PCS Storage: Complete Guide to Storing Household Goods During Military Moves

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Government covers storage (NTS - Non-Temporary Storage) for OCONUS unaccompanied tours, deployments, or special circumstances. Costs: $0 for authorized NTS (90 days standard CONUS, up to full tour OCONUS). Private storage: $50-$300/month (climate-controlled). Before storing: Purge 30-50% of items (saves weight allowance for future PCS), inventory everything (photos + list), use climate control for valuables. Average family stores 2,000-5,000 lbs during OCONUS tours. Claim damage within 9 months of delivery.

## When You Need PCS Storage

### Government-Authorized NTS (Non-Temporary Storage)

**Automatically authorized:**
- ✅ OCONUS unaccompanied tour (Korea 12 months, remote assignments)
- ✅ OCONUS accompanied tour with limited housing (government quarters can't fit all HHG)
- ✅ Deployment (store HHG while deployed, family moves to smaller place)
- ✅ TDY >20 weeks (long training, temporary assignments)
- ✅ Government quarters assignment (base housing smaller than your HHG)

**May be authorized (request approval):**
- Separation/retirement (90 days storage while transitioning)
- Medical hold (extended medical treatment away from permanent station)
- Special circumstances (hardship, unique situations)

**NOT authorized:**
- ❌ CONUS PCS (you're expected to move everything to new location)
- ❌ Convenience storage ("I don't want to unpack yet")
- ❌ Storing extra stuff you don't need (purge instead)

### How Much Storage (Weight Allowance)

**Your total weight allowance includes stored + shipped HHG:**
- E-5: 9,000 lbs total (maybe 3,000 lbs storage, 6,000 lbs ship to OCONUS)
- E-7: 13,000 lbs total
- O-3: 14,500 lbs total
- O-5: 17,500 lbs total

**Common split (OCONUS tour):**
- Ship to OCONUS: 40-60% (essentials, clothes, basic furniture)
- Storage (NTS): 40-60% (bulky furniture, seasonal items, sentimental items)

### Storage Duration Limits

**CONUS storage:**
- Standard: 90 days (3 months)
- Can request extension (case-by-case approval)

**OCONUS storage:**
- Duration of tour (1-3 years standard)
- Korea: Up to 12 months
- Japan/Germany: Up to 3 years
- Remote assignments: Duration of assignment

## Private Storage vs. Government NTS

### Government NTS (Free if Authorized)

**Pros:**
- ✅ $0 cost (government pays)
- ✅ Managed by military (TMO handles logistics)
- ✅ Insurance included (up to $6,000 per pound, max $40,000 total)
- ✅ No hassle (movers pack, store, deliver)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Must be authorized (can't use for convenience)
- ❌ Limited access (can't visit storage to get items)
- ❌ Slow retrieval (request delivery, wait 30-60 days)
- ❌ Damage risk (items moved 3 times: pack, storage, delivery)

**Cost:** $0 (if authorized)

### Private Storage (Self-Storage Unit)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Access anytime (visit storage to get/add items)
- ✅ No authorization needed (rent on your own)
- ✅ Flexible (month-to-month, cancel anytime)
- ✅ Control (you pack, you decide what goes in)

**Cons:**
- ❌ You pay ($50-$300/month = $600-$3,600/year)
- ❌ Not reimbursed (out-of-pocket expense)
- ❌ You handle logistics (rent truck, move items yourself)
- ❌ Less insurance (standard storage insurance = limited)

**Cost:**
- 5x10 unit (small): $50-$100/month
- 10x10 unit (1 bedroom): $100-$150/month
- 10x20 unit (2-3 bedroom): $150-$250/month
- Climate-controlled: +$50-$100/month

**When to use private storage:**
- Short-term storage during PCS (while house hunting)
- Storing items not covered by government (extra vehicles, personal items)
- Want access to items during storage

## How to Request Government Storage

### Step 1: Determine Eligibility (60-90 Days Before PCS)

**Check authorization:**
- OCONUS orders = Usually automatic
- Unaccompanied tour = Automatic
- Other scenarios = Ask TMO

### Step 2: Submit Storage Request

**Documents needed:**
- PCS orders
- Weight allowance calculation (how much storing vs. shipping)
- Justification (if non-standard storage request)

**Where to submit:**
- Base Transportation Office (TMO)
- Or online via military.move.mil

### Step 3: Schedule Pack & Pickup

**Timeline:**
- Request storage: 45-60 days before PCS
- TMO assigns moving company
- Movers come, pack, pick up
- Items go to storage facility

**Day of pickup:**
- Movers pack items marked "Storage"
- You sign inventory
- Items loaded onto truck
- Delivered to storage warehouse

### Step 4: Storage Confirmation

**Within 1-2 weeks:**
- Receive storage confirmation (lot number, facility address)
- Keep this document (need it to request delivery later)

**Important:** You likely WON'T visit storage facility (items go to commercial warehouse, not accessible to you)

## Preparing Items for Long-Term Storage

### Packing Tips (Prevent Damage)

**Furniture:**
- Clean thoroughly (dust, dirt = damage over time)
- Disassemble large pieces (beds, tables)
- Wrap in furniture pads (movers provide)
- Remove cushions (store separately, prevent compression)

**Electronics:**
- Original boxes if possible (best protection)
- Wrap in bubble wrap + blankets
- Remove batteries (prevent corrosion)
- Label cables (easier reassembly later)

**Clothing:**
- Clean before storage (stains set over time)
- Use wardrobe boxes (hang suits, dresses)
- Vacuum-seal seasonal clothes (saves space)
- Add mothballs (prevent damage)

**Books:**
- Pack flat (prevent spine damage)
- Use small boxes (books = heavy)
- Wrap valuable books in acid-free paper

**Kitchen items:**
- Wrap dishes individually
- Use dish pack boxes (reinforced)
- Label "Fragile" clearly

**Avoid storing:**
- ❌ Food (attracts pests)
- ❌ Liquids (leak, damage other items)
- ❌ Hazmat (paint, chemicals, batteries)
- ❌ Firearms/ammo (special regulations)

### Climate Control (Worth It?)

**Climate-controlled storage:**
- Temperature: 55-85°F (prevents warping, cracking)
- Humidity: 30-50% (prevents mold, rust)
- Cost: +$30-$50/month (government NTS usually not climate-controlled)

**Items needing climate control:**
- Wood furniture (warps in heat/humidity)
- Electronics (sensitive to temperature swings)
- Leather (cracks in dry heat)
- Musical instruments (warping, damage)
- Photos, documents (yellowing, mold)

**If using government NTS:** Can't request climate control (assigned warehouse may or may not have it)

**If using private storage:** Worth paying extra for valuables

## Retrieving Items from Storage

### Government NTS Retrieval

**How to request delivery:**
1. Contact TMO at current duty station
2. Provide storage lot number
3. Request delivery to current address
4. Wait 30-60 days (delivery timeline)

**Cost:** $0 (government pays)

**Timeline:**
- Request: Submit 45-60 days before needed
- Coordination: TMO schedules with storage company
- Delivery: 7-30 days (after coordination complete)

**Tip:** Request delivery EARLY (if you need items by specific date, add 60-day buffer)

### Partial Retrieval (Can You Get Some Items, Not All?)

**Short answer:** Difficult

**Government NTS:** Usually "all or nothing" (entire lot delivered at once, not piecemeal)

**Workaround:** If you stored specific high-value items separately, MAY be able to request just those (case-by-case)

**Best practice:** Assume you can't access storage until permanent retrieval

## Storage Damage Claims

### How to File Claim

**Damage discovered at delivery:**
1. Note damage on delivery inventory (right away)
2. Take photos (damaged items + packing materials)
3. Get estimates (repair or replacement costs)
4. File claim with moving company (within 75 days of delivery for full replacement value, 9 months for depreciated value)

**Common storage damage:**
- Mold (humidity in non-climate-controlled storage)
- Water damage (roof leaks, flooding)
- Broken furniture (poor handling during moves)
- Missing items (theft, lost in warehouse)

**Claim limits:**
- Full Replacement Value (FRV): Up to $6,000 per pound (max $40,000 total)
- Depreciated value: Lower payout

**Timeline:**
- File claim: Within 75 days (FRV) or 9 months (depreciated)
- Company responds: 30-60 days
- Settlement: 60-120 days (if approved)

## Common PCS Storage Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Storing Everything (Wasting Weight Allowance)

**Reality:**
- Store 8,000 lbs during OCONUS tour
- Return, retrieve everything
- Realize you didn't need half of it (purge at new duty station)

**Fix:** Purge BEFORE storage (sell, donate, trash). Only store items you KNOW you want to keep.

**Rule:** If you haven't used it in 2 years, you don't need it. Donate it.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Inventorying Stored Items

**Reality:**
- Store boxes labeled "Misc"
- Retrieve 3 years later
- Open boxes: "What is this? Why did I keep this?"
- Also: Can't prove items missing if no detailed inventory

**Fix:** Detailed inventory (photos, list per box). Easier to file claim if items missing/damaged.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Storing Perishables/Prohibited Items

**Reality:**
- Store food, cleaning supplies, paint
- Items leak, attract pests, damage other belongings
- Moving company rejects claim (prohibited items)

**Fix:** Purge perishables, hazmat, liquids before pack

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Requesting Delivery Early Enough

**Reality:**
- PCS back from OCONUS
- Request storage delivery 2 weeks before report date
- TMO: "It takes 60 days"
- You have no furniture for 6 weeks

**Fix:** Request delivery 60-90 days ahead

### ❌ Mistake #5: Using Storage for Hoarding

**Reality:**
- Store items "just in case"
- Pay for private storage for 5+ years ($5,000-$10,000 total)
- Never use items

**Fix:** Be ruthless. If you wouldn't buy it again today for storage cost, don't store it.

**Remember:** Storage is a tool, not a solution for hoarding. Purge ruthlessly before storing. Only keep items you KNOW you want long-term. Government NTS is free (if authorized) but inaccessible during storage. Private storage costs $50-$300/month but gives you access. Plan retrieval 60-90 days ahead to avoid delays.
