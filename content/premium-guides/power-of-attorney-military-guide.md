# Power of Attorney for Military: Complete Guide (General vs. Special POA)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** POA gives someone legal authority to act on your behalf. General POA = broad authority (finances, property, legal matters). Special POA = limited to specific tasks (selling car, accessing safe deposit box). Always use Special POA unless deploying. Free POA services at JAG offices on every base. POA does NOT give away your rights - you can revoke anytime.

## Types of POA

### General POA (Broad Authority)
**Grants wide-ranging powers:**
- Banking (deposits, withdrawals, account management)
- Real estate (buy, sell, refinance property)
- Legal matters (sign contracts, file lawsuits)
- Tax filings
- Vehicle transactions
- Insurance claims
- Government benefits

**When to use:**
- Deployments (6+ months)
- Extended TDY/training
- Remote assignments where spouse needs full authority

**Risk:** Grants SIGNIFICANT power. Choose someone trustworthy.

### Special (Limited) POA
**Grants specific, narrow authority:**
- One-time tasks only
- Expires after task complete or set date
- Cannot be used for anything else

**Examples:**
- Sell specific vehicle (VIN listed)
- Close bank account at specific institution
- Sign lease for apartment at specific address
- File specific tax return

**When to use:**
- PCS moves (spouse selling car, closing accounts)
- Specific transactions while you're unavailable
- Any time you DON'T need general POA

**Lower risk:** Limited scope, time-limited.

### Durable POA vs. Non-Durable
**Durable POA:**
- Remains valid if you become incapacitated
- Used for estate planning

**Non-Durable POA:**
- Ends if you become incapacitated
- Standard for most military POAs

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Granting General POA When Special POA Is Enough
**Reality:** You give spouse general POA to sell your car. They could also clean out bank accounts, sell house, etc.

**Fix:** Use special POA for specific tasks. Only use general POA for deployments.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Getting POA Before Deployment
**Reality:** You deploy without POA. Spouse can't access accounts, pay bills, handle emergencies.

**Fix:** Get POA 30+ days before deployment. Don't wait until last minute.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Choosing Wrong Person as Agent
**Reality:** You give POA to family member who misuses it.

**Fix:** Choose someone trustworthy, financially responsible. Usually spouse or parent.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Keeping Copies
**Reality:** You lose POA. Bank won't accept your word. You have to go back to JAG, redo everything.

**Fix:** Get 5+ certified copies. Store in safe place. Give copies to agent.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Forgetting to Revoke After Return
**Reality:** You return from deployment. POA still active. Agent could still use it years later.

**Fix:** Revoke POA within 30 days of returning. Send revocation to banks, etc.

## State-Specific Considerations

### Some States Require Recording
**Real estate POAs:**
- Must be recorded with county clerk
- Costs $20-$50
- Required to sell property

### Military POAs Are Broadly Accepted
**Federal law (SCRA):**
- States must accept military-issued POAs
- No need to get state-specific POA in most cases

## Medical POA (Separate Document)

### What Is Medical POA?
**Allows agent to:**
- Make medical decisions if you're incapacitated
- Access medical records
- Consent to treatment
- Make end-of-life decisions (if specified)

### How to Get It
- Free at JAG
- Different form than financial POA
- Often called "Healthcare Power of Attorney" or "Healthcare Proxy"

### Who Should Have It
- Spouse
- Parents (backup)
- **NOT the same person as financial POA** (creates conflict of interest if they're also beneficiary)

---

## POA for Specific Situations

### POA for VA Benefits
**Allows agent to:**
- File VA disability claims
- Appeal VA decisions
- Access VA records
- Manage VA payments

**Form:** VA Form 21-22a (Appointment of Individual as Claimant's Representative)

**If you die:**

**Remember:** POA is a powerful legal tool. Use it wisely. Grant only the authority needed. Choose a trustworthy agent. And always revoke when no longer needed. Don't deploy without it - but don't hand out general POAs like candy either.
