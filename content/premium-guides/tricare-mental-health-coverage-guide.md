## Common Mental Health Myths (BUSTED)

### ❌ Myth #1: "Seeking mental health care will ruin my career/security clearance"
**Reality:** 
- Getting help does NOT automatically disqualify you
- Not getting help and having a crisis DOES hurt your career
- Security clearance cares about UNTREATED conditions, not treated ones

### ❌ Myth #2: "My command will find out if I go to mental health"
**Reality:**
- If you go OFF-BASE, your command is NOT notified
- If you use MFLC or Military OneSource, NO medical record is created
- HIPAA protects your privacy

### ❌ Myth #3: "TRICARE won't cover 'real' therapy, just a few visits"
**Reality:**
- TRICARE covers UNLIMITED outpatient visits
- As long as it's medically necessary
- Many service members do weekly therapy for years

### ❌ Myth #4: "I'll get kicked out if I admit I have depression/anxiety"
**Reality:**
- Millions of service members have been treated for mental health issues and continued serving
- Treatment shows you're taking care of yourself
- Only severe, untreated conditions lead to separation

### ❌ Myth #5: "Medication will make me a zombie"
**Reality:**
- Modern antidepressants are well-tolerated
- Side effects are usually mild and temporary
- You can adjust dosage or try different medications
- Not everyone needs medication (therapy alone often works)
