## Common CLEP Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Taking Test Without Checking College's Policy
**Reality:** You pass test. College doesn't accept it. Wasted time.

**Fix:** Verify college accepts test BEFORE taking it.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Using Free Resources
**Reality:** You pay $200 for prep course. Modern States offers same content free.

**Fix:** Use Modern States (free). Only buy paid resources if free isn't enough.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Under-Studying
**Reality:** "It's only 50% to pass, I'll wing it." You fail. Have to retake (wait 3 months).

**Fix:** Study 2-4 weeks. Take practice tests. Aim for 70%+ on practice (ensures you pass real test).

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Taking CLEP While Active Duty
**Reality:** You wait until after separation. Now you pay $89 per test instead of free.

**Fix:** Take CLEP while active duty (free via DANTES).

### ❌ Mistake #5: Stopping After One Test
**Reality:** You pass one test. Stop. Could've passed 10 tests = 30 credits = $10,000 saved.

**Fix:** Take 1 test per month. In 1 year = 12 tests = 36+ credits = potentially 1.5 years of college done.
