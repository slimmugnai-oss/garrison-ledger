# Deployment Financial Preparation: Complete Money Management Guide

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Deployments offer unique savings opportunities (combat pay tax-free, fewer expenses, CZTE, SDP 10% guaranteed return). Most service members save $10,000-$30,000 per deployment with proper planning. Key: Max out Roth TSP with tax-free income, use SDP, set up auto-pay for bills, create budget for spouse, avoid buying stupid stuff when you return.

## Deployment Pay & Allowances

### Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE)

**What it is:**
- ALL pay earned in combat zone is TAX-FREE (up to maximum officer pay)
- Includes: Base pay, hostile fire pay, hazard pay
- Excludes: BAH, BAS (already tax-free)

**Example: E-5 in Afghanistan (6 months)**
- Base pay: $3,500/month × 6 = $21,000
- Normal tax: 12% = $2,520
- Combat zone tax: $0
- **Savings: $2,520**

**Example: O-3 in Iraq (12 months)**
- Base pay: $6,500/month × 12 = $78,000
- Normal tax: 22% = $17,160
- Combat zone tax: $0
- **Savings: $17,160**

### Hostile Fire Pay / Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP)
- **Amount:** $225/month
- **Tax-free** (in combat zone)
- Automatic in designated areas

### Hardship Duty Pay (HDP)
- **Amount:** $50-$150/month (varies by location)
- Compensates for harsh conditions

### Family Separation Allowance (FSA)
- **Amount:** $250/month
- After 30+ days separation
- Paid to service member, supports family at home

## Savings Deposit Program (SDP) - 10% Guaranteed Return

### What Is SDP?

**Best investment available:**
- Deposit up to $10,000 during deployment
- Guaranteed 10% annual return (compounded quarterly)
- FDIC insured
- No stock market risk
- Tax-free interest (if combat zone deployment)

### Eligibility
- Deployed to designated combat zone
- Must be in theater 30+ consecutive days or 1+ day in 3 consecutive months

### How It Works

**Example: Deploying for 12 months**
- Month 1: Deposit $1,000
- Month 2: Deposit $1,000
- Continue until $10,000 total
- Interest accrues at 10%/year
- After deployment: Withdraw principal + interest

**Total return on $10,000 for 12-month deployment:**
- $10,000 principal
- Average time invested: 6 months
- Interest: $500
- **Total: $10,500**

**If left in SDP for 90 days after deployment:**
- Interest continues accruing
- Total return: ~$1,000 on $10,000 (10%)

### Where to Find SDP
- myPay (while deployed)
- Finance office on deployment location
- Set up allotment to SDP

### Best Strategy
- Max out ASAP ($10,000)
- Leave for full deployment + 90 days after
- Withdraw before 90 days post-deployment (interest stops)

## Roth TSP Strategy for Deployments

### The Golden Rule: Switch to 100% Roth TSP Before Deployment

**Why:**
- Combat pay is TAX-FREE going in
- Roth TSP is TAX-FREE coming out
- **Double tax-free benefit = NEVER PAY TAXES**

**Example: E-5 deployed 12 months**
- Combat pay: $42,000 (tax-free)
- Contribute $23,000 to Roth TSP (2025 max)
- At retirement: Withdraw $23,000 + growth TAX-FREE
- **Effective tax rate: 0% forever**

**Compare to Traditional TSP:**
- Same $23,000 contributed
- Tax-free going in (CZTE)
- But TAXED when withdrawn (22% bracket)
- Lose $5,060 to taxes
- **Roth is clearly better**

## Deployment Budget for Family at Home

### Create Two Budgets

**Budget #1: While You're Deployed**
- Spouse spends less (no entertainment, date nights, your expenses)
- But some costs increase (childcare if needed, home maintenance)

**Example monthly budget:**
- Rent/mortgage: $1,500
- Utilities: $200
- Groceries: $600
- Gas: $200
- Kids activities: $150
- Misc: $200
- **Total: $2,850/month**

**Budget #2: Your Income During Deployment**
- Base pay: $3,500 (tax-free)
- BAH: $1,900
- BAS: $460
- HFP: $225
- **Total: $6,085/month**

**Savings potential:** $6,085 - $2,850 = **$3,235/month**

**Over 9-month deployment: $29,115 savings**

## Setting Up Auto-Pay (Before Deployment)

### Bills to Automate
1. ✅ Rent/mortgage (via bank auto-pay)
2. ✅ Utilities (electric, gas, water)
3. ✅ Car payment + insurance
4. ✅ Credit cards (minimum payment, not full balance)
5. ✅ Phone bill
6. ✅ Internet/cable

**Why:** Prevents late payments, protects credit score, reduces spouse stress

### Give Spouse Financial POA
- Allows spouse to handle emergencies
- Access accounts if needed
- Pay unexpected bills
- Free at JAG office

## Common Deployment Financial Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Coming Home and Blowing All Savings
**Reality:** You save $30,000 during deployment. Come home. Buy $40,000 truck (with loan). Savings gone + in debt.

**Fix:** Set rule: Savings stay in HYSA for 90 days after return. Don't make big purchases immediately.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Switching to Roth TSP
**Reality:** You leave TSP in Traditional during deployment. Miss out on $5,000+ in tax savings.

**Fix:** Switch to Roth TSP before deployment. Switch back after if you want.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Using SDP
**Reality:** You leave $10,000 sitting in checking account earning 0.01%. Could've earned $500-$1,000 at 10% in SDP.

**Fix:** Max SDP ASAP during deployment.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Spouse Overspending While You're Gone
**Reality:** You deploy. Spouse spends $4,000/month (vs. $2,800 budget). You return to $0 savings + credit card debt.

**Fix:** Create budget together BEFORE deployment. Weekly spending check-ins. Transparency.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Setting Up Auto-Pay
**Reality:** You forget to pay car payment. Credit score drops 100 points. Can't get mortgage later.

**Fix:** Auto-pay everything before you leave.
