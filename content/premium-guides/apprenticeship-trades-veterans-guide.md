# Apprenticeships & Skilled Trades for Veterans: $60K-$100K Career Without College Degree

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Skilled trades (electrician, plumber, HVAC, welder) pay $60K-$100K+ after 4-year apprenticeship. No college degree required. Veterans preferred by trade unions (Helmets to Hardhats program). Get paid while learning ($20-$30/hour as apprentice, $35-$60/hour as journeyman). GI Bill covers apprenticeship + BAH (get paid twice - apprentice wages + BAH). Trades shortage = high demand (retiring boomers, not enough young workers). Lifetime career (can't be outsourced, AI can't replace electrician). Pension + healthcare via union (similar to military benefits).

## Why Skilled Trades Are Perfect for Veterans

### Military Skills Transfer to Trades

**Military experience:**
- Physical work (used to manual labor)
- Discipline (show up on time, follow procedures)
- Safety-conscious (critical in trades)
- Team player (apprentice → journeyman → mentor)
- Problem-solving (troubleshooting systems)

**Trades value these skills:**
- Veterans = preferred hires (lower risk, proven work ethic)

### No College Degree Required

**Apprenticeship path:**
1. High school diploma (or GED) ✅
2. Apply to apprenticeship (union or non-union)
3. Get accepted (interview, aptitude test)
4. Work + learn (4-5 year apprenticeship)
5. Become journeyman (licensed tradesperson)

**No student debt:**
- College: $40K-$100K+ debt
- Apprenticeship: $0 debt (actually PAID while learning)

### Income Progression

**Apprentice (Years 1-4):**
- Year 1: $20-$25/hour ($40K-$50K/year)
- Year 2: $25-$30/hour ($50K-$60K/year)

- Year 4: $35-$40/hour ($70K-$80K/year)

**Journeyman (Year 5+):**
- $40-$60/hour ($80K-$120K/year)
- Overtime common ($100K-$150K with OT)

**Master tradesperson (10-20 years):**
- $50-$75/hour ($100K-$150K+)
- OR start own business ($150K-$300K+ as owner)

**Retirement:**
- Union pension ($2,000-$4,000/month)
- Social Security
- Savings
- **Plus military pension if you did 20 years** (dual pensions!)

## Using GI Bill for Apprenticeships

### GI Bill Covers Apprenticeships

**How it works:**
- Enroll in registered apprenticeship
- VA pays BAH (decreases each 6 months as you earn more)
- Year 1: 100% BAH ($1,500-$3,500/month depending on location)
- Year 2: 80% BAH
- Year 3: 60% BAH
- Year 4: 40% BAH
- Year 5: 20% BAH

**Why decreasing:**
- You're earning more as apprentice (year 1 = $40K, year 4 = $70K)
- VA supplements less as you make more

**Total benefit:**
- Apprentice wages: $40K-$80K over 4 years ($160K total)
- GI Bill BAH: $50K-$80K over 4 years (decreasing)
- **Total income during apprenticeship: $210K-$260K** (get paid while learning!)

**vs. College:**
- College: Pay $60K tuition, earn $0
- Apprenticeship: Earn $210K+ while learning

**Which is better?**
- Depends on career goals (engineer needs college, electrician doesn't)
