## Common Financial Mistakes to Avoid

### The "Deployment Bonus" Trap
**Mistake:** Treating deployment savings as "bonus money" to spend freely  
**Reality:** This is your emergency fund, retirement savings, and family security  
**Solution:** Allocate deployment savings to specific financial goals

### The "Catch-Up" Spending Spree
**Mistake:** Trying to "make up" for missed experiences while deployed  
**Reality:** Overspending on vacations, gifts, and experiences  
**Solution:** Budget for reasonable "welcome home" expenses, save the rest

### The "New Car" Syndrome
**Mistake:** Buying a new car with deployment savings  
**Reality:** Cars depreciate 20% in first year, deployment savings don't  
**Solution:** Buy used car with cash, or finance at low rate and invest savings

### The "Investment" Scam
**Mistake:** Investing in "get rich quick" schemes or high-risk investments  
**Reality:** Most deployment savings should go to safe, long-term investments  
**Solution:** Stick to TSP, index funds, and proven investment strategies
