## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Your TSP allocation should change as you age, shifting from aggressive growth (80-100% stocks) in your 20s to conservative stability (50-70% bonds) near retirement. Most service members are better off with a **custom portfolio** (C, S, I funds) than the Lifecycle Funds, which are too conservative too early and cost you tens of thousands in lost growth.

**For most service members under 40: 60% C Fund, 20% S Fund, 20% I Fund. Adjust more conservative as you approach 50+.**

## Understanding TSP Funds

### **The 5 Core Funds**

1. **G Fund (Government Securities)**
   - **What it is:** Ultra-safe government bonds
   - **Return:** ~2-3% annual (2024: 4.1% due to high interest rates)
   - **Risk:** Zero (cannot lose money)
   - **Use case:** Preservation, not growth

2. **F Fund (Fixed Income)**
   - **What it is:** Corporate and government bonds
   - **Return:** ~3-5% annual
   - **Risk:** Low (can lose value short-term)
   - **Use case:** Stability in volatile markets

3. **C Fund (Common Stock - S&P 500)**
   - **What it is:** Tracks the S&P 500 (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.)
   - **Return:** ~10% annual average (long-term)
   - **Risk:** Medium-high (can swing ±20% in a year)
   - **Use case:** Core growth engine

4. **S Fund (Small Cap Stock)**
   - **What it is:** U.S. small/mid-cap companies
   - **Return:** ~11-12% annual average (long-term)
   - **Risk:** High (more volatile than C Fund)
   - **Use case:** Aggressive growth

5. **I Fund (International Stock)**
   - **What it is:** Developed international markets (Europe, Asia, Australia)
   - **Return:** ~8-9% annual average (long-term)
   - **Risk:** Medium-high (currency + market risk)
   - **Use case:** Diversification outside U.S.

### **Lifecycle Funds (L Funds)**

- **What they are:** Pre-mixed portfolios that automatically rebalance based on target retirement date
- **Options:** L 2030, L 2035, L 2040, L 2045, L 2050, L 2055, L 2060, L 2065, L Income
- **Problem:** They shift to bonds WAY too early, costing you growth

**Example:** L 2050 Fund (for someone retiring in ~2050, currently in their 30s)
- **Current allocation (2025):** 75% stocks, 25% bonds
- **Problem:** A 30-year-old should be 90-100% stocks, not 75%
- **Cost:** Lost growth over 20-30 years = $50,000-$100,000+

## TSP Allocation by Age & Career Stage

### **Ages 18-30: Maximum Aggression (90-100% Stocks)**

**Why:** You have 30-40+ years until retirement. Short-term volatility doesn't matter. Time heals all stock market crashes.

**Recommended Allocation:**
- **60% C Fund** (S&P 500 - core growth)
- **20% S Fund** (small caps - aggressive growth)
- **20% I Fund** (international diversification)
- **0% G Fund, 0% F Fund**

**Rationale:**
- Stocks average 10% annual returns long-term
- Bonds average 3-4% returns
- Over 30 years: 10% growth = $1 becomes $17.45 | 4% growth = $1 becomes $3.24

**Real Example: E-3 Contributing 5% ($175/month)**
- Age 20 → 60 at 10% annual return: **$1.1 million**
- Age 20 → 60 at 4% annual return (too much G/F Fund): **$358,000**
- **Cost of being too conservative: $742,000 lost**

### **Ages 30-40: Still Aggressive (80-90% Stocks)**

**Why:** You still have 20-30 years until retirement. Volatility is opportunity, not risk.

**Recommended Allocation:**
- **50% C Fund**
- **20% S Fund**
- **20% I Fund**
- **10% F Fund** (starting to add some stability)
- **0% G Fund**

**Adjustment Strategy:**
- If market crashes 20%+, temporarily increase stock allocation to 90-95% (buy the dip)
- If within 5 years of deployment, shift 10-20% to G Fund for preservation

**Real Example: E-6 with 12 Years, Contributing 10% ($400/month)**
- Current TSP balance: $80,000
- Age 35 → 60 at 9% annual return: **$1.2 million**
- Age 35 → 60 at 5% annual return (too conservative): **$620,000**
- **Cost of early conservatism: $580,000 lost**

### **Ages 40-50: Gradual Shift (70-80% Stocks)**

**Why:** You have 10-20 years left. Still need growth, but start adding stability.

**Recommended Allocation:**
- **45% C Fund**
- **15% S Fund**
- **15% I Fund**
- **15% F Fund** (bonds for stability)
- **10% G Fund** (preservation)

**Adjustment Strategy:**
- Each year after 45, shift 2-3% from stocks to bonds
- By 50: Target 65-70% stocks, 30-35% bonds

**Real Example: O-4 with 18 Years, Contributing 15% ($900/month)**
- Current TSP balance: $350,000
- Age 45 → 60 at 8% annual return: **$1.5 million**
- Age 45 → 60 at 4% annual return (too conservative): **$950,000**
- **Cost of over-conservatism: $550,000 lost**

### **Ages 50-60: Conservative Growth (50-65% Stocks)**

**Why:** You're approaching retirement. Balance growth with preservation.

**Recommended Allocation (Age 50-55):**
- **35% C Fund**
- **10% S Fund**
- **10% I Fund**
- **25% F Fund**
- **20% G Fund**

**Recommended Allocation (Age 56-60):**
- **30% C Fund**
- **5% S Fund**
- **10% I Fund**
- **30% F Fund**
- **25% G Fund**

**Rationale:**
- Still need some growth to combat inflation
- Adding bonds/G Fund to reduce volatility as you near withdrawal
- Target: Smooth ride into retirement, not maximum growth

### **Ages 60+: Preservation & Income (30-40% Stocks)**

**Why:** You're withdrawing or about to. Preserve what you've built.

**Recommended Allocation:**
- **20% C Fund**
- **10% I Fund**
- **40% F Fund**
- **30% G Fund**

**Withdrawal Strategy:**
- TSP allows monthly installments
- Target 4% annual withdrawal rate (e.g., $1M balance = $40K/year)
- Keep 2 years of withdrawals in G Fund (safe buffer)

## Lifecycle Fund vs. Custom Portfolio: The Numbers

### **Scenario: 25-Year-Old E-4 Contributing $200/month for 35 Years**

**Option A: L 2060 Fund (Lifecycle)**
- Starts ~85% stocks, gradually shifts to ~20% stocks by age 60
- Average return over 35 years: ~7.5%
- **Final Balance at age 60: $452,000**

**Option B: Custom Portfolio (Recommended)**
- 60% C, 20% S, 20% I until age 40
- Gradual shift to 50-30-20 by age 50
- Further shift to 35-25-15-25 by age 60
- Average return over 35 years: ~9.2%
- **Final Balance at age 60: $658,000**

**Difference: $206,000 more with custom portfolio**

**Why the Difference?**
- Lifecycle Funds shift to bonds too early
- Bonds earn 4-5% vs. stocks' 10% long-term
- Over 35 years, that 1.7% difference compounds to $200K+

---

## Special Situations

### **Deploying Soon?**

**Strategy: Shift 20-30% to G Fund 6 months before deployment**

**Why:**
- You can't easily rebalance while deployed
- If market crashes during deployment, you can't adjust
- G Fund = stability during uncertainty

**After deployment:** Shift back to your age-appropriate allocation

### **Separating/Retiring Soon?**

**Strategy: Shift to 40-50% G/F Fund 2 years before separation**

**Why:**
- You'll need cash soon (lump sum pension, TSP withdrawals)
- Can't risk a 20% market crash right before you need the money
- Preserve what you've built

### **Market Crash Happening?**

**DO NOT PANIC SELL.**

**Strategy: INCREASE stock allocation (buy the dip)**

**Historical Proof:**
- 2008 Crash: S&P 500 dropped 50%, then recovered +300% over next 10 years
- 2020 COVID: S&P dropped 35% in March, recovered by August, +100% by 2023
- Those who sold locked in losses. Those who bought made fortunes.

**Action Plan:**
1. Check your allocation
2. If you're under 50, consider increasing stocks by 10-20%
3. If you have extra cash, max TSP contributions ($23,500/year in 2025)
4. Set it and forget it - check back in 6 months

## BRS vs. High-3: How It Impacts TSP Strategy

### **BRS (Blended Retirement System)**

**TSP Matching:** Government matches up to 5% of base pay

**Strategy:** ALWAYS contribute at least 5% to get full match

**Math:**
- E-5 with 6 years: Base pay $3,500/month
- 5% contribution: $175/month (you) + $175/month (match) = **$350/month total**
- **That's $2,100/year in FREE MONEY**

**If you're not getting the full 5% match, you're literally throwing away free money.**

### **High-3 (Legacy System)**

**No TSP Matching:** You're on your own

**Strategy:** Still max TSP (or at least 10-15%)

**Why:**
- High-3 pension is better, but TSP is still essential
- Inflation erodes pension value over time
- TSP grows tax-deferred
- You'll need more than just pension in retirement

## How to Rebalance Your TSP

### **Step 1: Log Into TSP.gov**

Go to [www.tsp.gov](https://www.tsp.gov), log in with your account

### **Step 2: Check Current Allocation**

Click "Account Balance" → See your current fund breakdown

### **Step 3: Make Interfund Transfer (IFT)**

**"Interfund Transfer" = Move money between funds NOW**

- Click "Contribution Allocations"
- Click "Interfund Transfers"
- Enter new percentages (must total 100%)
- **You get 2 IFTs per month** (use them strategically)

**Example:**
- Current: 100% L 2050 Fund
- New: 60% C Fund, 20% S Fund, 20% I Fund

### **Step 4: Change Future Contributions**

**"Contribution Allocation" = Where FUTURE paychecks go**

- Click "Contribution Allocations"
- Enter percentages for each fund
- This affects FUTURE contributions, not current balance

**TIP:** Do BOTH interfund transfer (move existing money) AND contribution allocation (future contributions) to fully realign

### **Step 5: Set Calendar Reminder**

**Rebalance annually** (every January, for example)

**Why:**
- If stocks outperform, you might be 75% stocks when you wanted 60%
- Rebalancing = "sell high, buy low" automatically
- Takes 5 minutes once a year

## Common Mistakes That Cost Money

### **Mistake #1: Setting It and Forgetting It (Wrong Allocation)**

**Problem:** Default TSP allocation is 100% G Fund (0% growth)

**Cost:** E-5 contributing $200/month for 20 years
- G Fund at 3%: **$66,000**
- Proper allocation at 9%: **$134,000**
- **Cost: $68,000 lost**

**Fix:** Check your allocation RIGHT NOW. If it's 100% G Fund or L Income Fund, change it immediately.

### **Mistake #2: Chasing Last Year's Winner**

**Problem:** "S Fund was up 30% last year, I'll put 100% there!"

**Cost:** S Fund crashes 40% next year (as volatile funds do)

**Fix:** Diversify. 60-20-20 spreads risk while maintaining growth.

### **Mistake #3: Panic Selling During Crashes**

**Problem:** Market drops 20%, you sell everything to G Fund, locking in losses

**Cost:** Miss the recovery (stocks always recover long-term)

**Fix:** Ignore short-term volatility. Better yet, BUY MORE stocks during crashes.

### **Mistake #4: Ignoring TSP Because "I Have a Pension"**

**Problem:** "High-3 pension is enough, I don't need TSP"

**Reality:** Pension inflation adjustments lag real inflation. TSP grows.

**Fix:** Max TSP regardless of retirement system. You'll need both.

### **Mistake #5: Not Getting the BRS 5% Match**

**Problem:** Contributing 3% when you should contribute 5%

**Cost:** $2,100/year in free money (for E-5) = $52,500 over 25-year career

**Fix:** Contribute AT LEAST 5% if you're under BRS. No exceptions.

## Real-World Examples

### **Example 1: E-4 Age 22, Just Started TSP**

**Profile:**
- Rank: E-4 with 2 years
- Base Pay: $2,800/month
- Current TSP: $3,000 (been contributing 5%)
- BRS: Yes (getting 5% match)

**Recommended Allocation:**
- **65% C Fund, 20% S Fund, 15% I Fund**

**Strategy:**
- Max BRS match (contribute 5% = $140/month + $140 match = $280/month)
- Increase contribution by 1% every promotion
- By E-6: Contributing 10-15%
- By age 60: **$1.2 million+**

### **Example 2: O-3 Age 35, Moderate TSP Balance**

**Profile:**
- Rank: O-3 with 10 years
- Base Pay: $7,500/month
- Current TSP: $120,000 (contributed sporadically)
- BRS: No (High-3 legacy system)

**Current Allocation (Problem):**
- 100% L 2050 Fund (too conservative)

**Recommended Allocation:**
- **55% C Fund, 20% S Fund, 15% I Fund, 10% F Fund**

**Strategy:**
- Interfund transfer: Move $120K to new allocation
- Contribution allocation: 15% going forward ($1,125/month)
- By age 60: **$2.1 million**
- If stayed in L 2050: **$1.6 million**
- **Gain from switching: $500,000**

### **Example 3: E-7 Age 48, Close to Retirement**

**Profile:**
- Rank: E-7 with 22 years
- Base Pay: $5,200/month
- Current TSP: $450,000 (maxed contributions for years)
- Retiring at 55 (33 years TIS)

**Current Allocation (Problem):**
- 70% C/S/I, 30% G/F (still too aggressive for retirement timeline)

**Recommended Allocation:**
- **40% C Fund, 10% I Fund, 30% F Fund, 20% G Fund**

**Strategy:**
- Shift 20% from stocks to bonds (reduce volatility risk)
- Each year until retirement: Shift another 5% to bonds/G Fund
- By age 55: 30% stocks, 70% bonds/G (preservation mode)
- Projected balance at retirement: **$750,000**
