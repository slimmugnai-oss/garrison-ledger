# Salary Negotiation for Veterans: How to Get What You're Worth

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Military members often undervalue themselves in civilian job market. Research salary ranges (Glassdoor, Salary.com) BEFORE interview. Expect initial offer to be 10-20% below maximum. Always negotiate (90% of employers expect it). Formula: Ask for 10-15% above their offer, settle at 5-10% increase. Veterans who negotiate earn $5,000-$15,000/year more than those who accept first offer.

## Why Veterans Leave Money on the Table

### Military Culture vs. Civilian
**Military:**
- Pay is non-negotiable (fixed by rank/TIS)
- Asking for more money = not how it works

**Civilian:**
- Pay is ALWAYS negotiable
- Employers EXPECT you to negotiate
- First offer is rarely their best offer

### Common Veteran Mindset Issues

**"I should be grateful for the offer"**
- Reality: Employer wants you too (or they wouldn't make offer)
- You have leverage

**"I don't want to seem greedy"**
- Reality: Negotiation is normal business practice
- Employers respect candidates who know their worth

**"What if they rescind the offer?"**
- Reality: Rescinding offers due to negotiation is extremely rare (<1%)
- If they rescind for polite negotiation, you dodged a bullet (toxic employer)

**Formula:**
1. Research market rate: $60,000-$80,000
2. Adjust for your experience: +$5,000 (military leadership = valuable)
3. Your target: $65,000-$85,000
4. Your minimum acceptable: $60,000 (walk away if below)

## Salary Negotiation Script (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Receive Offer

**Recruiter:** "We'd like to offer you the position at $65,000/year."

**You (Don't accept immediately):** "Thank you! I'm excited about this opportunity. Can I have 24-48 hours to review the offer?"

**Why:** Buys you time to research, prepare counter-offer, not react emotionally

### Step 2: Research (That Evening)

**Check:**
- Is $65,000 fair for this role/location?
- What's market rate? ($60,000-$80,000)
- What's YOUR target? ($75,000)

**Decide:**
- Accept as-is? (If it's above your target)
- Counter-offer? (If it's below target)
- Walk away? (If it's below minimum)

### Step 3: Counter-Offer (Next Day)

**You (Email or phone):**

"Thank you for the offer. I'm very excited about the opportunity to join [Company] as [Role]. Based on my research of market rates for this position in [Location], along with my 10 years of leadership experience and [specific skills], I was hoping for a salary in the range of $75,000. Is there flexibility in the offer?"

**Why this works:**
- Shows you researched (not arbitrary number)
- Ties to your value (experience, skills)
- Asks politely ("Is there flexibility?")
- Doesn't demand

### Step 4: Handle Recruiter Response

**If they say YES (increase to $72,000):**
- "That's great, thank you. Let me review and get back to you by end of day."
- Decide: Accept $72,000? (You asked for $75k, got $72k = good outcome)

**If they say NO:**
- "I understand. Is there flexibility in other areas - signing bonus, additional PTO, relocation assistance, professional development budget?"

**If they say "That's our final offer":**
- Decide: Accept $65,000 OR walk away
- If it's above your minimum ($60k), probably accept
- If below minimum, politely decline and continue job search

### Step 5: Accept Offer

**You:**
"Thank you for working with me. I'm happy to accept the position at $72,000. What are the next steps?"

**Get offer in writing:**
- Ask for written offer letter
- Review carefully (salary, benefits, start date)
- Sign and return

## What to Negotiate (Beyond Base Salary)

### 1. Signing Bonus
- One-time payment (usually $5,000-$20,000 for mid-level roles)
- If they can't increase salary, sometimes can add signing bonus

### 2. Additional PTO (Paid Time Off)
- Standard: 10-15 days/year
- Negotiate: 15-20 days (especially if you're senior)

**Script:** "I understand the salary range. Would it be possible to start with 20 PTO days instead of 15, given my experience?"

### 3. Remote Work Flexibility
- Full remote OR hybrid (2-3 days/week from home)
- Valuable for military spouses (PCS flexibility)

### 4. Relocation Assistance
- If PCSing to job location
- Ask for: $5,000-$15,000 relocation package
- Covers moving costs, temporary housing

### 5. Professional Development Budget
- $2,000-$5,000/year for certifications, conferences, training

### 6. Earlier Performance Review
- "Can we review salary after 6 months instead of 12 months?"
- Gives you chance to prove value and get raise sooner

## Salary Negotiation by Situation

### Situation 1: First Civilian Job (Transitioning Veteran)

**Your leverage:**
- Lower (no civilian track record)
- But military leadership experience is valuable

**Strategy:**
- Research market rate thoroughly
- Ask for market rate (not 20% above)
- Emphasize transferable skills
- Be willing to accept lower end of range (to get foot in door)

**Example:**
- Market rate: $60,000-$80,000
- Initial offer: $62,000
- Counter: $68,000
- Settle at: $65,000

### Situation 2: Job Offer Below Market Rate

**Your leverage:**
- High (you know it's below market)

**Strategy:**
- Present market data
- Ask for market median
- Be willing to walk away if they won't budge

**Example:**
- Market rate: $70,000-$90,000 (median: $80,000)
- Initial offer: $65,000
- Counter: $80,000 (with market data)
- Settle at: $75,000 or walk away

### Situation 3: Multiple Offers

**Your leverage:**
- Extremely high

**Strategy:**
- "I have another offer at $X. I prefer your company, but need competitive compensation."
- Let them compete
- Choose best overall package (not just highest salary)

## Common Negotiation Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Accepting First Offer Immediately
**Reality:** "I accept!" Employer was prepared to go 10% higher.

**Fix:** ALWAYS ask for 24-48 hours. Always counter (even if offer is good).

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Researching Market Rate
**Reality:** You have no idea if $70,000 is fair. You accept. Later find out market rate is $85,000.

**Fix:** Research BEFORE interview. Know your worth.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Giving Salary Requirements Too Early
**Recruiter (phone screen):** "What's your salary requirement?"

**Bad answer:** "$80,000"

**Why bad:** If their budget was $90,000, you just cost yourself $10,000.

**Good answer:** "I'm focusing on finding the right role. Once we determine I'm a good fit, I'm confident we can agree on fair compensation. What's the budgeted range for this position?"

### ❌ Mistake #4: Negotiating Aggressively
**Reality:** "I need $90,000 or I walk." (Hostile tone)

**Fix:** "I was hoping for $90,000 based on market research and my experience. Is there flexibility?" (Polite, professional)

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Getting Offer in Writing
**Reality:** Verbal offer of $75,000. Written offer shows $68,000. Bait and switch.

**Fix:** Don't resign from current job or stop job search until you have WRITTEN offer.
