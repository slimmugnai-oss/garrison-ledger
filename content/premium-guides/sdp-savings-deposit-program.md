## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

The Savings Deposit Program (SDP) is the single best **guaranteed investment** available to service members deployed to designated combat zones. You can deposit up to $10,000 and earn **10% annual interest** (compounded quarterly) - risk-free, government-backed, and better than any savings account or CD in America.

**If you're deploying to a combat zone and don't max out SDP, you're leaving free money on the table.**

## What is SDP?

The Savings Deposit Program allows service members serving in designated combat zones to save up to **$10,000** and earn **10% annual interest**, compounded quarterly. This is:

- **4-5x better** than the best high-yield savings accounts (~2%)
- **Guaranteed** by the U.S. government (zero risk)
- **Tax-advantaged** if deposited from combat zone pay (CZTE - Combat Zone Tax Exclusion)
- **Available ONLY during deployment** to qualifying locations

### Who Qualifies?

You must be:
- Serving in a **designated combat zone** (IRS-defined)
- On active duty for **30 consecutive days or more** in the combat zone
- Receiving **hostile fire pay or imminent danger pay**

**Common qualifying locations (as of 2025):**
- Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria
- Arabian Peninsula (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, UAE, etc.)
- Jordan, Djibouti
- Other IRS-designated combat zones

**Check your LES:** If you see "HFP" (Hostile Fire Pay) or "IDP" (Imminent Danger Pay), you likely qualify.

## How SDP Works

### Maximum Deposit: $10,000
You can deposit up to **$10,000 total** during your deployment. This is a **cumulative lifetime limit per deployment period**, not per month.

### Interest Rate: 10% Annual (Compounded Quarterly)
- **2.5% per quarter** (10% annual √∑ 4 quarters)
- **Compounded** - you earn interest on your interest

**Example Calculation:**
- Deposit $10,000 on Day 1 of deployment
- After 3 months (1 quarter): $10,000 √ó 1.025 = **$10,250**
- After 6 months (2 quarters): $10,250 √ó 1.025 = **$10,506.25**
- After 12 months (4 quarters): **$11,038.13**

**Result:** $1,038.13 in guaranteed interest on a $10,000 deposit over 1 year.

### When Interest Accrues
- Interest starts accruing **the day your deposit is received**
- Interest is compounded **quarterly** (every 3 months)
- Interest continues accruing for **up to 90 days after you leave the combat zone**

### Withdrawal Rules
- You **cannot withdraw** while deployed (money is locked in)
- Money is returned **within 120 days after leaving the combat zone**
- Final payment includes principal + all accrued interest
- Payment is made via direct deposit or check

## How to Maximize SDP

### Strategy 1: Deposit Early and Often
**The earlier you deposit, the more interest you earn.**

- **Best:** Deposit $10,000 immediately upon arriving in the combat zone
- **Good:** Deposit as much as possible in the first 30-60 days
- **Suboptimal:** Wait until month 6 of a 12-month deployment (you miss 6 months of interest)

**Why it matters:**
- Depositing $10,000 on Day 1 vs. Day 180 means **$500+ difference** in interest earned

### Strategy 2: Use Combat Zone Pay
If you deposit money **earned in the combat zone** (which is tax-free due to CZTE), your SDP returns are effectively **tax-free too**.

**Example:**
- E-5 with 6 years deployed to Kuwait
- Base pay: $3,500/month (tax-free in combat zone)
- Deposit $3,500/month √ó 3 months = $10,000 (hits max)
- Earn $1,038 interest over 12 months (tax-free)

### Strategy 3: Pre-Save Before Deployment
If you know you're deploying in 6 months, **start saving now** so you can hit the $10,000 max on Day 1.

**Pre-Deployment Savings Plan (6 months out):**
- Month 1-6: Save $1,667/month
- Deployment Day 1: Deposit full $10,000 to SDP
- Result: Maximum interest earned

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: E-5 Deploying to Kuwait for 12 Months

**Profile:**
- Rank: E-5 with 6 years
- Base Pay: $3,500/month (tax-free in combat zone)
- BAH: $1,700/month (continues, even downrange)
- Deployment: 12 months in Kuwait

**SDP Strategy:**
- Pre-deployment: Save $5,000 before leaving
- Month 1 of deployment: Deposit $5,000 (from pre-savings) + $5,000 (from combat zone pay) = **$10,000 total**
- Months 2-12: Let interest compound

**Results After 12 Months:**
- Principal: $10,000
- Interest Earned: **$1,038.13** (10% compounded quarterly)
- Total Received: **$11,038.13**
- Plus: 90 days of additional interest after returning home (~$253 more)
- **Grand Total: ~$11,291**

**Bottom Line:** You earned **$1,291 in guaranteed interest** just for deploying. That's free money for doing what you were already doing.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Waiting Too Long to Deposit
**Problem:** Service members wait until month 6+ of deployment to start depositing.  
**Cost:** Lose 6+ months of interest (easily $400-500).  
**Fix:** Deposit as early as possible, ideally within first 30 days.

### Mistake #2: Not Hitting the $10,000 Max
**Problem:** "I'll just deposit $5,000 and keep the rest liquid."  
**Cost:** Miss out on $500+ in interest.  
**Fix:** Max out SDP first, THEN save elsewhere. SDP is the best return you'll ever get.

### Mistake #3: Not Verifying Eligibility
**Problem:** Assume you qualify without checking.  
**Cost:** Deposit gets rejected or delayed.  
**Fix:** Check your LES for HFP/IDP. Verify your location is IRS-designated combat zone.

### Mistake #4: Forgetting About the 90-Day Bonus
**Problem:** Forget that interest continues for 90 days AFTER leaving the combat zone.  
**Benefit:** Extra $200-300 in interest you didn't even have to be deployed to earn.  
**Action:** Don't stress about withdrawal timing - the government handles it automatically.

## How to Enroll in SDP

### Step 1: Verify Eligibility
- Check your LES for **HFP (Hostile Fire Pay)** or **IDP (Imminent Danger Pay)**
- Confirm you've been in the combat zone for **30+ consecutive days**
- Verify your location is an **IRS-designated combat zone**

### Step 2: Complete DD Form 2558
- Get form from your finance office or unit admin
- Fill out:
  - Personal info
  - Deposit amount (up to $10,000 total)
  - Allotment amount (if doing monthly deposits)
- Sign and submit to your unit finance office

### Step 3: Set Up Allotment (Recommended)
**Best Method:** Set up a monthly allotment from your pay.

**Example:**
- Allotment: $2,500/month √ó 4 months = $10,000
- Pros: Automatic, forces you to save, hits max quickly
- Cons: None (you can always stop the allotment if needed)

### Step 4: Verify Deposit
- Check with finance office after 30-60 days
- Verify deposit was received and interest is accruing
- Get confirmation statement

**Don't assume it worked - verify it.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I withdraw money early?
**No.** SDP is locked during deployment. You get your money back 90-120 days after leaving the combat zone.

### What if I need emergency funds?
**Plan ahead.** Keep a separate emergency fund (3-6 months expenses) BEFORE maxing SDP. SDP should be "extra" money you don't need.

### Can I do this on every deployment?
**Yes.** You can participate in SDP on **every qualifying deployment**. The $10,000 limit resets for each deployment period.

### Is the interest taxable?
**It depends.** If you deposit **combat zone pay** (tax-free), the interest is also tax-free. If you deposit **non-combat pay**, the interest is taxable.

### What happens if I get injured or leave early?
Interest continues for **90 days after you leave the combat zone**, regardless of why you left. You still get paid out within 120 days.

### Can I add money after hitting $10,000?
**No.** $10,000 is a hard cap. Once you hit it, you're done (which is a good problem to have).
