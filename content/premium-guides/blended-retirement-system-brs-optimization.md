# Blended Retirement System (BRS): Complete Optimization Guide

**Bottom Line Up Front:** BRS gives you TSP match (5% of base pay = $40,000-$200,000 lifetime value) + smaller pension (2% per year vs. 2.5% under Legacy High-3). To maximize BRS: Contribute 5%+ to TSP from day one, stay 20+ years for pension, invest TSP aggressively (C Fund), understand Continuation Pay at 12 years. BRS is better if you serve <20 years. Legacy is better if you retire at exactly 20.

## BRS vs. Legacy High-3 (Quick Comparison)

| **Feature** | **BRS (Blended Retirement System)** | **Legacy High-3** |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Who it applies to** | Joined after 2018 OR opted in before 2018 | Joined before 2006, OR 2006-2017 and didn't opt into BRS |
| **Pension multiplier** | 2% per year of service | 2.5% per year |
| **TSP match** | 5% match (automatic 1% + match 4%) | No match |
| **Continuation Pay** | Lump sum at 12 years (2.5x-13x monthly base pay) | No continuation pay |
| **Best for** | Those who might not do 20 years | Those staying exactly 20 years |

## BRS Components

### 1. TSP Matching (The Big Benefit)

**How it works:**
- **Automatic 1%:** Military contributes 1% of your base pay even if you contribute $0
- **Match up to 4%:** If you contribute 5%, military matches 4% (total: 5% match)
- **Vesting:** After 2 years of service, match is YOURS forever

**Lifetime value of 5% match:**

**Example: E-5 over 20-year career**
- Average base pay: $3,500/month
- 5% match: $175/month
- Over 20 years: $42,000 contributed by military
- **At 7% growth: $87,000 value by retirement**

**Example: O-3 over 20-year career**
- Average base pay: $6,000/month
- 5% match: $300/month
- Over 20 years: $72,000 contributed by military
- **At 7% growth: $149,000 value by retirement**

### 2. Pension (Reduced Multiplier)

**Formula:**
```
BRS Pension = Final Base Pay × Years of Service × 2%
```

**Example: E-7 retiring at 20 years**
- Final base pay: $5,200/month
- Years: 20
- Pension: $5,200 × 20 × 2% = **$2,080/month**

**Compare to Legacy High-3:**
- Same E-7
- Pension under High-3: $5,200 × 20 × 2.5% = **$2,600/month**
- **Difference: $520/month less under BRS**

**But don't forget TSP match!** BRS has $87,000 in TSP that Legacy doesn't.

### 3. Continuation Pay (Lump Sum at 12 Years)

**What it is:**
- One-time lump sum payment if you commit to 4 more years (to 16 years total)
- Paid around year 12 mark
- Amount varies by branch and career field

**Multiplier:**
- **Active duty:** 2.5x - 13x monthly base pay (depending on branch/job)
- **Reserve:** 0.5x - 6x monthly base pay

**Example: E-6 at 12 years**
- Base pay: $4,000/month
- Continuation Pay: 2.5x = $10,000 (typical for most non-critical jobs)
- Must serve to 16 years

**Example: Pilot (critical field)**
- Base pay: $7,000/month
- Continuation Pay: 13x = $91,000
- Must serve to 16 years

**Tax:** Continuation Pay is taxable income (25% withheld usually)

## BRS Optimization Strategy

### Strategy #1: Contribute 5% from Day One

**Why:**
- Maximize TSP match
- $175-$300/month in free money
- Compounds over 20 years = $80,000-$150,000

**How:**
- Log into myPay
- Set TSP contribution to 5% (or more)
- Never drop below 5%

### Strategy #2: Invest TSP in C Fund (100% Stocks)

**Why:**
- BRS relies more on TSP growth than Legacy
- C Fund averages 10-11% annually (vs. G Fund's 2-3%)
- You have 20-40 years for compounding

**Example:**
- $300/month for 20 years at 10% = $228,000
- Same at 2% (G Fund) = $88,000
- **Difference: $140,000**

### Strategy #3: Take Continuation Pay, Stay to 20

**Why:**
- Get lump sum at 12 years ($10,000-$91,000)
- Serve to 20 for pension
- Total value: Pension + TSP + Continuation Pay

**Example: E-7, 20 years, BRS**
- Pension: $2,080/month = $24,960/year
- TSP (with match): $150,000 at retirement
- Continuation Pay: $10,000 at year 12
- **Total retirement value: $174,960 + pension for life**

### Strategy #4: If Separating Before 20, BRS Is Better

**Why:**
- Legacy gives you $0 if you separate before 20 years
- BRS gives you TSP match (vested after 2 years)

**Example: Serving 8 years, then separate**
- BRS: Keep $35,000 TSP match + your contributions
- Legacy: Get $0 retirement benefit
- **BRS wins**

## BRS vs. Legacy High-3 (Which Is Better?)

### BRS Is Better If:
- ✅ You're unsure if you'll do 20 years
- ✅ You're disciplined with TSP investing (5%+, C Fund)
- ✅ You want flexibility (TSP is portable, pension isn't)
- ✅ You value lump sum continuation pay

### Legacy High-3 Is Better If:
- ✅ You're 100% certain you'll retire at exactly 20 years
- ✅ You want higher guaranteed pension ($520/month more for E-7)
- ✅ You're risk-averse (prefer guaranteed pension over TSP)

### Break-Even Analysis

**At 20 years:**
- BRS pension: $24,960/year
- Legacy pension: $31,200/year
- **Difference: $6,240/year in favor of Legacy**

**But BRS has:**
- TSP match: $87,000-$150,000
- Continuation Pay: $10,000-$91,000

**To break even:**
- If you live 14-24 years in retirement, Legacy catches up in total value
- But if you invest TSP well, BRS can still win

## Common BRS Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Contributing 5% to TSP
**Reality:** You contribute 0%. You lose $175-$300/month in free match = $87,000-$150,000 over career.

**Fix:** Contribute AT LEAST 5%. Ideally 10-15%.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Putting TSP in G Fund
**Reality:** You put TSP in "safe" G Fund (2.4% return). You lose $140,000 in growth vs. C Fund.

**Fix:** Put TSP in C Fund (or L Fund if you want autopilot).

### ❌ Mistake #3: Separating Before 2 Years (Lose TSP Match)
**Reality:** You separate at 18 months. TSP match isn't vested. Government takes back $3,000.

**Fix:** Serve at least 2 years to vest TSP match.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Declining Continuation Pay
**Reality:** You decline continuation pay at year 12. You leave $10,000-$91,000 on table.

**Fix:** Accept continuation pay IF you plan to serve to 16+ years anyway.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Thinking BRS = Less Money
**Reality:** "BRS gives smaller pension, so Legacy is better."

**Truth:** BRS pension is smaller, but TSP match + Continuation Pay often make up for it (and then some).

## Opt-In Decision (For Pre-2018 Service Members)

### Who Had the Choice?
- Joined between 2006-2017
- Had option to opt into BRS in 2018

- Pension reduction hurt more than TSP match helped (for them)

### If You Opted Into BRS

**Make sure you:**
- Contribute 5%+ to TSP immediately
- Invest in C Fund
- Take continuation pay at year 12

3. ✅ Make informed decision about career length

### Annually:
1. ✅ Check TSP balance
2. ✅ Verify 5% contributions still happening
3. ✅ Rebalance to C Fund if needed

**Remember:** BRS trades guaranteed pension for flexibility and portability. If you're disciplined with TSP (contribute 5%+, invest in stocks, stay 20+ years), BRS is fantastic. If you're 100% doing 20 years and want simplicity, Legacy High-3 gives higher pension. Either way, max that TSP match — it's free money.
