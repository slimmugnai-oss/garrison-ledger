# Blended Families in Military: Stepchildren, BAH, ID Cards & Benefits Complete Guide

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Blended families (remarriage with kids from previous relationships) are common in military (30-40% of military marriages are remarriages). BAH: Get with-dependent rate if ANY dependent (biological or step-kids living with you). Stepchildren get DEERS/military ID, TRICARE, commissary access if living with you >50% of time. Adoption not required for benefits. Estate planning CRITICAL - designate guardians, update beneficiaries (SGLI, TSP), consider life insurance to equalize inheritance (biological kids vs. stepkids). Relationships: Set boundaries early, don't force "new parent" role, respect ex-spouse co-parenting, be patient (blending takes 3-7 years).

## BAH for Blended Families

### When You Get With-Dependent BAH

**You get WITH-dependent BAH if:**
- ✅ Married with stepchildren living with you (even part-time >50%)
- ✅ Stepchildren claimed as dependents on taxes
- ✅ You provide >50% financial support

**You don't get extra BAH per child:**
- BAH is flat rate (with-dep vs. without-dep)
- 1 stepchild = same BAH as 5 stepchildren

### Dual Military Blended Families

**Example:**
- You (E-6): 2 kids from first marriage
- Spouse (E-5): 1 kid from first marriage
- Married now, 3 kids total in household

**BAH:**
- You: E-6 with-dep BAH ($3,000/month)
- Spouse: E-5 with-dep BAH ($2,800/month)
- Combined: $5,800/month

**Same as dual military with biological kids together** (no BAH difference for blended vs. biological)

## Stepchild Benefits (DEERS, TRICARE, Commissary)

### DEERS Enrollment (Required for All Benefits)

**Stepchildren qualify if:**
- ✅ Married to their parent (your spouse)
- ✅ Stepchild lives with you >50% of time
- ✅ You provide >50% financial support
- ✅ Stepchild is under 21 (or 23 if full-time college)

**Documents needed (bring to DEERS office):**
- Marriage certificate (proves you're married to their parent)
- Stepchild's birth certificate (proves parent-child relationship)
- Custody agreement OR affidavit (proves they live with you >50%)

**Result:** Stepchild gets military dependent ID card

### TRICARE Coverage

**Stepchildren get TRICARE if:**
- ✅ Enrolled in DEERS
- ✅ Living with you >50% of time

**Coverage level (same as biological kids):**
- Active duty: TRICARE Prime (free, $0 copays)
- Retired/Guard/Reserve: TRICARE Select ($copays)

**Biological parent (ex-spouse) coverage:**
- Ex-spouse does NOT get TRICARE (unless 20/20/20 rule: married 20 years, service member had 20 years service, 20 years overlap)

**Custody implications:**
- Week-on/week-off custody: Stepchild has TRICARE when with you, must use civilian insurance when with ex
- This gets complicated (coordinate with ex-spouse on medical appointments)

### Commissary, Exchange, Base Access

**Stepchildren get:**
- ✅ Base access (with dependent ID)
- ✅ Commissary shopping
- ✅ Exchange (BX/PX)
- ✅ MWR facilities (gym, pool, youth programs)

**Same privileges as biological kids** (if enrolled in DEERS)

## Custody & Co-Parenting with Ex-Spouse

### When Ex-Spouse is Cooperative

**Best case:**
- Ex understands military life (PCS, deployments)
- Flexible with custody modifications
- Communicates about kid's needs
- Shares medical/school info

**Make it work:**
- Keep ex informed (PCS orders, deployment dates)
- Offer makeup time (if you miss visitation due to duty)
- Don't bad-mouth ex to kids
- Use OurFamilyWizard app (custody calendar, communication log)

### When Ex-Spouse is Difficult

**Common issues:**
- Refuses to modify custody for PCS
- Withholds visitation (claiming "military takes you away from kids")
- Demands more child support (because you got promoted)
- Uses kids as pawns

**Legal protections (SCRA - Servicemembers Civil Relief Act):**
- Can't lose custody JUST because you PCS/deploy
- Can request custody hearing delay if deployed
- Must be given opportunity to arrange care (not automatic custody to ex)

**Action steps:**
1. Hire lawyer (free consult via base legal)
2. File motion to modify custody (if ex is unreasonable)
3. Document EVERYTHING (texts, emails, visitation denials)
4. Consider guardian ad litem (court-appointed child advocate)

### PCS with Stepchildren (Custody Issues)

**Scenario:**
- You get PCS orders (Texas → Germany)
- Spouse's kids from first marriage (custody shared 50/50 with ex in Texas)
- Ex refuses to allow kids to move to Germany

**Options:**
- Spouse stays in Texas with kids (geo-bachelor arrangement)
- Spouse goes to Germany, kids stay with ex full-time (custody modified)
- Fight in court (expensive, uncertain outcome)

**Court factors:**
- What's in best interest of child? (stability vs. military family)
- Ex's objection (courts often side with non-moving parent)
- Child's age (older kids have more say)

**Reality:** Many blended military families split during OCONUS PCS (spouse with kids stays CONUS, service member goes alone)

## Financial Planning for Blended Families

### Child Support (Paying or Receiving)

**If you pay child support:**
- Still required even if remarried (new spouse's income doesn't eliminate obligation)
- PCS doesn't change amount (unless you file modification)
- Deployment pay increase = may trigger modification (ex can request more)

**If spouse receives child support:**
- Ex's child support counts as income (for budgeting)
- Ex stops paying = affects household finances (military can't force ex-spouse to pay)

### Life Insurance (Equalizing Inheritance)

**Problem:**
- You die, everything goes to new spouse
- Biological kids from first marriage: Get nothing (or minimal)
- Stepkids: Get everything (via spouse inheriting)

**Solution: Life insurance for biological kids**
- SGLI: Spouse is beneficiary ($500K)
- Buy separate term life: Biological kids are beneficiaries ($500K-$1M)
- Now inheritance is equalized

**Example:**
- You have 2 kids from first marriage
- Remarry, spouse has 1 kid
- SGLI ($500K) → New spouse (she can support her kid + yours)
- Separate $500K policy → Your 2 biological kids ($250K each)

**Cost:** $500K term life = $30-$50/month (age 35, healthy)

### Estate Planning (Wills, Trusts)

**Simple will may not work for blended families:**

**Problem with simple will:**
- "Everything to spouse" = Spouse inherits, may not leave anything to your biological kids when she dies

**Solution: Trust**
- Assets go to trust
- Spouse gets income from trust (lives off it)
- When spouse dies, trust principal goes to YOUR biological kids
- Ensures biological kids eventually inherit

**Cost:** $2,000-$5,000 (consult estate attorney, worth it for blended families)

### SGLI Beneficiary (Who Gets $500K?)

**Options:**
- 100% to new spouse (she can support all kids, biological + step)
- Split: 50% spouse, 50% biological kids (ensures your kids get something)
- 100% to biological kids (if you don't trust spouse to support them)

**Consider:**
- Age of kids (minor kids can't receive SGLI directly, needs guardian)
- Spouse's financial responsibility
- Relationship with ex-spouse (will ex support your kids if you die?)

## Relationship Dynamics (Stepparent Role)

### Setting Boundaries Early

**Discuss BEFORE marriage:**
- Discipline: Who disciplines stepkids? (biological parent vs. stepparent)
- Rules: Unified household rules or different rules per kid?
- Finances: Separate accounts vs. joint? (especially if child support involved)
- Ex-spouse: How much communication is OK? (co-parenting vs. overstepping)

**Common mistake:** Assuming "we'll figure it out" (leads to conflict)

### Stepparent Authority (How Much?)

**Early stage (first 2 years):**
- Stepparent = friendly adult (NOT parent yet)
- Biological parent handles discipline
- Stepparent enforces household rules (but doesn't punish)

**Later stage (3+ years):**
- Stepparent can discipline (if relationship with stepkids is strong)
- Unified parenting (both enforce rules)

**Red flag:** Forcing stepparent role too fast ("You WILL respect me, I'm your new dad/mom!")

**Better:** Earn respect over time (be consistent, fair, supportive)

### "You're Not My Real Parent" (Handling It)

**Kid says this (during conflict):**
"You can't tell me what to do, you're not my real dad/mom!"

**Bad response:**
- "I married your mom/dad, so yes I am!"
- "Your real dad/mom isn't even here!"

**Good response:**
- "You're right, I'm not your biological parent. But I care about you, and in this house we have rules. Your mom/dad and I are both enforcing them."

**Acknowledge feelings, enforce boundaries**

### Favoritism (Avoiding It)

**Perception of favoritism KILLS blended families:**
- Service member favors biological kids over stepkids (OR vice versa)
- Spouse favors her biological kids
- Kids notice, resentment builds

**How to avoid:**
- Equal treatment (birthday gifts, privileges, discipline)
- Don't trash talk ex in front of stepkids (vs. supporting your own kids against their ex)
- Unified rules (no "my kids vs. your kids")

---

## Deployment & Blended Families

### Family Care Plan (Stepchildren)

**If you deploy, who cares for stepkids?**

**Option 1:** Biological parent (your spouse) stays home (she doesn't deploy)
- Stepkids stay with her (their bio parent)
- Your bio kids: Go to your ex-spouse OR stay with your spouse

**Option 2:** Both deploy (dual military blended family)
- Your bio kids → Your ex-spouse
- Spouse's bio kids → Her ex-spouse
- OR all kids → Designated guardian (grandparents, family friend)

**Complication:**
- Ex-spouses may fight for custody (use deployment to request modification)

### Telling Stepkids About Deployment

**Age-appropriate:**
- Young kids (3-7): "Mommy/Daddy is going on a trip for work, will be back in X months"
- Older kids (8-12): Explain deployment, show on map, talk about communication plan
- Teens (13+): Honest about deployment, potential dangers (but don't overshare)

**Stepparent role during deployment:**
- Support biological parent (your spouse)
- Maintain routines
- Don't try to replace deployed parent (avoid "I'm the parent now" energy)

## Common Blended Family Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Rushing Blending ("We're a Family Now!")

**Reality:**
- Get married, expect instant Brady Bunch
- Kids resist, stepparent feels rejected
- Conflict, resentment

**Fix:** Blending takes 3-7 years (be patient, build relationships slowly)

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Updating Beneficiaries

**Reality:**
- Remarry, forget to update SGLI/TSP beneficiaries
- Still lists ex-spouse
- You die, ex gets $500K (not new spouse)

**Fix:** Update beneficiaries IMMEDIATELY after remarriage

### ❌ Mistake #3: Letting Ex-Spouse Control Your Life

**Reality:**
- Ex constantly calls, demands changes to visitation, threatens court
- You cave to avoid conflict
- Your new spouse resents ex's control

**Fix:** Set boundaries (communicate only about kids, use OurFamilyWizard app, involve lawyer if needed)

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Having "The Money Talk"

**Reality:**
- You pay child support, spouse receives child support
- Never discuss finances (separate accounts, no transparency)
- Resentment builds ("I'm paying for your kids but you won't contribute to mine")

**Fix:** Financial transparency (joint budget, discuss child support, agree on spending)

## Action Steps

### Before Remarriage:
1. ✅ Discuss: Parenting styles, discipline, finances, ex-spouse boundaries
2. ✅ Introduce kids slowly (don't rush blending)
3. ✅ Consult lawyer (prenup, custody implications)

### After Remarriage:
1. ✅ Enroll stepkids in DEERS (within 30 days)
2. ✅ Update SGLI/TSP beneficiaries
3. ✅ Create/update will + Family Care Plan
4. ✅ Set household rules (unified parenting approach)

### Every PCS:
1. ✅ Consult ex-spouse early (custody modifications needed?)
2. ✅ Update custody agreement (if moving OCONUS or far away)
3. ✅ Plan for visitation (how will kids see non-custodial parent?)

### Annually:
1. ✅ Review beneficiaries (SGLI, TSP, life insurance)
2. ✅ Update will (as kids age, family dynamics change)
3. ✅ Family check-in (how is blending going? Any issues?)
