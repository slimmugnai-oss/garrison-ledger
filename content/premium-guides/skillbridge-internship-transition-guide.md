# SkillBridge: Getting Paid Internships During Final 180 Days of Service

**Bottom Line Up Front:** SkillBridge allows active-duty members to intern with civilian companies during final 180 days of service (still get full pay/benefits). 3,000+ approved companies (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Boeing, police departments, trade unions). Apply 6-12 months before separation. Commander must approve. Best programs: Tech ($80K-$150K post-internship jobs), healthcare, skilled trades, federal contracting.

## Eligibility & Requirements

### Who Can Do SkillBridge?

**Eligible:**
- ✅ Active duty (all branches)
- ✅ Within 180 days of separation (ETS/EAS/DOS)
- ✅ Honorable discharge expected
- ✅ Commander approval

**NOT eligible:**
- ❌ Retirement in place (must actually separate)
- ❌ Reserves/National Guard (active duty only)
- ❌ Already separated (must apply while active)

### Commander Approval (The Gatekeeper)

**Why commanders deny:**
- Unit undermanned (can't afford to lose you for 6 months)
- Critical mission (deployment prep, inspection)
- You're not in good standing (PT failures, disciplinary issues)

**How to get approval:**
- Apply 6-12 months ahead (gives unit time to plan)
- Find replacement (cross-train someone to take your job)
- Make business case ("This helps me transition, improves readiness stats")
- Choose program aligned with military job (easier sell)

**Red flag timing:**
- Don't ask during deployment prep
- Don't ask during inspection season
- Don't ask if unit just lost multiple people

---

## How to Apply (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Research Programs (6-12 Months Before Separation)

**Where to find programs:**
- SkillBridge.osd.mil (official list, 3,000+ companies)
- Hiring Our Heroes SkillBridge page
- Company websites ("SkillBridge" in search bar)

**Criteria to evaluate:**
- Location (near where you want to live post-military)
- Industry (matches career goals)
- Conversion rate (% of interns hired)
- Company reputation (Glassdoor reviews)

### Step 2: Apply to Programs (6 Months Before)

**Apply to 10-20 programs** (competition is HIGH, especially for top companies)

**Application materials:**
- Resume (civilian format, no military jargon)
- Cover letter (why this company, why this role)
- Interview (phone/video screening)

**Timeline:**
- Apply: 6 months out
- Interview: 4-5 months out
- Offer: 3-4 months out

### Step 3: Get Commander Approval (3-4 Months Before)

**Required documents:**
- SkillBridge MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) from company
- Commander's approval memo

**How to ask:**
1. Schedule formal meeting with commander
2. Present: SkillBridge opportunity, company info, how it helps transition
3. Submit written request (formal memo)
4. Follow up if no response in 2 weeks

**If denied:**
- Ask why (unit manning? timing?)
- Negotiate (can I do 90 days instead of 180?)
- Reapply with different program (if timing was issue)

### Step 4: Start Internship (Final 180 Days)

**Logistics:**
- Move to internship location (use PCS to transition location if possible)
- BAH switches to internship ZIP code (verify with finance)
- Report to company (not military base)
- Still in military (uniform for official events, follow UCMJ)

**During internship:**
- Work full-time for company
- Prove yourself (this is 6-month job interview)
- Network (make connections)
- Perform (80% get job offers if they do well)

## Common SkillBridge Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Applying Too Late

**Reality:**
- 2 months before ETS: "I want to do SkillBridge"
- Commander: "Too late, unit needs you"
- Companies: "We filled our slots already"

**Fix:** Apply 6-12 months ahead

### ❌ Mistake #2: Only Applying to Top Companies

**Reality:**
- Apply to Google, Amazon, Microsoft only
- Get rejected (everyone applies, very competitive)
- Miss other great opportunities

**Fix:** Apply to 10-20 programs (mix of dream companies + solid backups)

### ❌ Mistake #3: Treating It Like a Vacation

**Reality:**
- SkillBridge is free 6-month internship, show up late, don't try hard
- Company doesn't hire you
- Wasted opportunity

**Fix:** Treat it like a 6-month job interview (because it IS)

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Researching the Company

**Reality:**
- Accept first SkillBridge offer
- Company culture terrible, or role not what you thought
- Stuck for 6 months (can't quit, you're still active duty)

**Fix:** Research company (Glassdoor, talk to veterans who worked there)

### ❌ Mistake #5: Thinking SkillBridge Guarantees Job

**Reality:**
- Complete SkillBridge, assume job offer coming
- Company: "Thanks, but no job for you"
- Scramble for job after separation

**Fix:** Apply for other jobs during SkillBridge (have backup plans)

---

## SkillBridge vs. Terminal Leave

### Can You Do Both?

**Yes, if timing allows:**
- SkillBridge: Final 180 days
- Terminal leave: Final 30-60 days

**Example timeline:**
- ETS: December 1
- SkillBridge: June 1 - October 31 (153 days)
- Terminal leave: November 1 - December 1 (30 days)

**Benefits:**
- Get training + job offer from SkillBridge
- Get extra month to relocate/relax (terminal leave)

**Check:** Some commanders make you choose (SkillBridge OR terminal leave, not both)

---

## Alternatives to SkillBridge

### If SkillBridge Denied

**Career Skills Program (CSP)**
- Similar to SkillBridge (civilian internship while active duty)
- Shorter (usually 30-90 days)
- Easier commander approval

**USERRA Apprenticeships**
- Start apprenticeship before separation
- Protected time off for training (USERRA = civilian employer must accommodate)

**Post-9/11 GI Bill + VET TEC**
- Separate, use GI Bill for training (get BAH while in school)
- VET TEC = free tech training (Google, Microsoft certifications)

**Hiring Our Heroes Fellowship**
- 12-week fellowship (for veterans, not active duty)
- Do AFTER separation
