**Bottom Line Up Front:** Military-friendly credit cards: USAA Cashback Rewards Plus (2.5% unlimited), Navy Federal More Rewards (3x points on gas/groceries/transit), Chase Sapphire Reserve (waived $550 fee via SCRA).

## Debt Payoff Strategy (If You Have Credit Card Debt)

### Debt Avalanche Method (Mathematically Optimal)

**How it works:**
1. List all debts (highest interest rate first)
2. Pay minimums on all
3. Put extra money toward highest-rate debt
4. When that's paid off, attack next highest
5. Repeat

**Example:**
- Card 1: $5,000 at 21% APR
- Card 2: $3,000 at 15% APR
- Card 3: $2,000 at 6% (SCRA-reduced)

**Pay order:** Card 1 → Card 2 → Card 3

**Why:** Saves most money in interest

### Debt Snowball Method (Psychologically Easier)

**How it works:**
1. List all debts (smallest balance first)
2. Pay minimums on all
3. Put extra toward smallest debt
4. When paid off, attack next smallest
5. Repeat

**Why:** Quick wins motivate you (pay off small debts fast)

**Best for:** Need motivation, have multiple small debts

### Balance Transfer Strategy (If Available)

**0% APR balance transfer:**
- Transfer high-interest balance to 0% APR card
- Usually 12-18 months at 0%
- Pay off aggressively during 0% period

**Example:**
- $10,000 at 18% APR
- Transfer to card with 0% for 18 months
- Transfer fee: 3% = $300
- Pay $555/month for 18 months = debt-free
- **Savings: $1,600 in interest** (vs. paying 18% for 18 months)

**Good 0% transfer cards:**
- Citi Diamond Preferred (21 months 0%)
- Chase Slate Edge (18 months 0%)
- Navy Federal Platinum (12 months 0%)

## Credit Card Rules for Military

### Golden Rules

**Rule #1: Pay Statement Balance in Full Monthly**
- NEVER carry balance
- Interest destroys wealth ($10,000 balance at 18% = $1,800/year in interest = wasted money)

**Rule #2: Only Spend What You Can Afford**
- Credit card isn't extra money
- If you can't pay cash, don't buy it

**Rule #3: Use for Rewards, Not Credit**
- Use cards for rewards/protections
- Pay off immediately
- Don't spend more just to get rewards

**Rule #4: Check Credit Score Quarterly**
- Free at CreditKarma.com, AnnualCreditReport.com
- Monitor for fraud
- Ensure good score (700+ for best rates)

**Rule #5: Don't Close Old Cards (Hurts Credit Score)**
- Length of credit history = 15% of credit score
- Keep oldest cards open (even if you don't use them)
- Just use once every 6 months to keep active

## Building Credit (For Junior Enlisted)

### Starting from No Credit

**Step 1: Secured Credit Card**
- Deposit $500 → Get $500 credit limit
- Use for small purchases ($50-$100/month)
- Pay in full monthly
- After 6-12 months, graduate to unsecured card

**Good secured cards:**
- Navy Federal Secured
- USAA Secured
- Discover Secured (cashback rewards)

**Step 2: Become Authorized User**
- Parent/spouse adds you to their card
- Their good payment history helps your credit
- Don't even need the physical card

**Step 3: Credit Builder Loan**
- Navy Federal/USAA offer credit builder loans
- Borrow $500-$1,000, pay back over 12 months
- Builds credit + saves money

### Credit Score Target by Rank

**E-1 to E-3 (First 2 years):**
- Target: 650-700
- Focus: Pay bills on time, keep utilization <30%

**E-4 to E-6 (Mid-career):**
- Target: 700-750

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Buying New Car with Credit Card Sign-Up Bonus as Down Payment
**Reality:** Get $500 bonus. Use as down payment on $30,000 car. Still have $28,000 loan at 7% APR.

**Fix:** Don't use credit card rewards to justify bad purchases. Rewards are bonus, not budget.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Carrying Balance "To Build Credit"
**Reality:** Myth. You don't need to pay interest to build credit.

**Fix:** Pay statement balance in full. Still builds credit, pays $0 interest.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Opening 5 Cards at Once
**Reality:** Multiple hard inquiries drop your credit score 20-50 points.

**Fix:** Open 1-2 cards per year maximum. Space out applications.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Using SCRA 6% Cap
**Reality:** Have old card at 24% APR. Don't know about SCRA. Pay $2,400/year in interest on $10,000 balance.

**Fix:** Apply for SCRA rate reduction on ALL cards from before active duty.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Canceling Cards with Annual Fees Without Checking SCRA
**Reality:** "This card has $95 annual fee, I'll cancel." But SCRA would waive it.

**Fix:** Check if card qualifies for MLA/SCRA fee waiver before canceling.

**Remember:** Credit cards are tools. Used wisely (pay in full, maximize rewards, use SCRA), they're valuable. Used poorly (carry balances, pay 18-24% interest), they're wealth destroyers. Military members have unique advantages (SCRA 6% cap, fee waivers) - use them.
