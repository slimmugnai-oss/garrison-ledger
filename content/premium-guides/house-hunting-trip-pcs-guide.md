# House-Hunting Trip (HHT): Complete Guide to Maximizing Your PCS Benefit

**Bottom Line Up Front:** House-Hunting Trip (HHT) = government-funded trip to new duty station before PCS (you + spouse, 10 days, airfare + hotel covered). Use it to find housing, research schools, explore area. Not required, but highly recommended for OCONUS or unfamiliar locations. Must be authorized in orders. Save $1,500-$3,000 by using HHT instead of rushing into first available apartment.

## Common HHT Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Requesting HHT in Orders
**Reality:** You take trip on your own dime. Not reimbursed.

**Fix:** Ensure HHT is explicitly authorized in PCS orders.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Going Too Early
**Reality:** You go 4 months before PCS. Housing market changes. Properties you liked are gone.

**Fix:** Schedule 30-60 days before PCS (sweet spot).

### ❌ Mistake #3: Only Looking at 2-3 Properties
**Reality:** You see 3 apartments, pick one, later realize you missed better options.

**Fix:** Schedule 10-15 viewings. Compare thoroughly.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Bringing Spouse (If Married)
**Reality:** You pick apartment alone. Spouse hates it. Resentment builds.

**Fix:** Bring spouse if married. Housing is shared decision.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Researching Schools
**Reality:** You pick housing in bad school district. Kid's education suffers.

**Fix:** Research GreatSchools.org ratings BEFORE selecting housing.
