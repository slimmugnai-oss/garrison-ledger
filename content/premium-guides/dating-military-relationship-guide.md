# Dating in the Military: Complete Relationship Guide (Deployment, PCS, Long-Distance)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Military dating is challenging due to deployments (6-12 months apart), frequent PCS (every 2-3 years), demanding schedules, and high divorce rates (3x civilian average). Success factors: communication, realistic expectations, independent partner, shared values. Red flags: marrying for BAH, rushing due to deployment, dating within chain of command. Best relationships start with friendship first.

## Dating While Active Duty (Challenges by Stage)

### Junior Enlisted (E-1 to E-4)

**Challenges:**
- Low pay ($25,000-$35,000/year)
- Live in barracks (can't bring partner over)
- Frequent relocations
- Less life stability

**Best approach:**
- Date someone independent (has own career, friends, hobbies)
- Avoid "barracks bunny" stereotype
- Don't rush marriage for BAH (see warning below)
- Focus on building career first

### Mid-Career (E-5 to E-7, O-1 to O-3)

**Challenges:**
- Deployment tempo increases
- Leadership responsibilities (less personal time)
- PCS frequency (every 2-3 years)

**Best approach:**
- Partner who understands military lifestyle
- Preferably someone with military connection (military kid, prior service, federal employee)
- Establish communication routines early

### Senior (E-8+, O-4+)

**Challenges:**
- Long hours (senior leadership)
- High stress
- Possible geo-bachelor assignments

**Benefits:**
- Financial stability ($80,000-$120,000+/year)
- Less frequent PCS
- More predictable schedule (no field time)

## Military Spouse Dating (For Civilians Considering Military Partner)

### What You're Signing Up For

**Expect:**
- 6-12 months apart during deployments
- Moving every 2-3 years
- Career sacrifices (hard to build career with frequent moves)
- Solo parenting during deployments
- Missing milestones (births, anniversaries, holidays)
- 40-50% chance of divorce (statistics, not destiny)

**Benefits:**
- Healthcare (TRICARE - worth $500+/month)
- Housing allowance (BAH - $1,500-$3,500/month)
- Job security (military can't be "laid off")
- Retirement pension (after 20 years)
- Built-in community (other military spouses)
- Adventure (travel, OCONUS assignments)

### Questions to Ask BEFORE Getting Serious

**Ask partner:**
1. How long do you plan to stay in military? (4 years vs. 20 years vs. 30 years = very different lives)
2. What's your deployment tempo? (Infantry = frequent, Finance = rare)
3. Where have you been stationed? (Helps you visualize future)
4. Do you want kids? (Kids + military = extra complexity)
5. How do you handle stress? (Deployment stress, PTSD, etc.)

**Ask yourself:**
1. Can I handle 6-12 months alone?
2. Am I willing to move every 2-3 years?
3. Can I sacrifice my career for theirs?
4. Do I have support system (family, friends who understand)?
5. Am I independent enough to thrive solo?

## Common Military Dating Red Flags

### üö© Marrying for BAH

**The scheme:**
- Junior enlisted marry after 2 months of dating
- Primary motive: Get out of barracks, get BAH increase

**Why it's a bad idea:**
- Marriage is HARD (adding military stress makes it harder)
- BAH increase ($400-$800/month) doesn't justify lifelong commitment
- Divorce costs $5,000-$20,000 (wipes out years of BAH "savings")
- 60-70% of BAH marriages end in divorce

**Better approach:**
- Date for 12-18 months minimum
- Marry because you love them, not for money
- BAH should be bonus, not reason

### üö© Rushing Due to Deployment

**The scenario:**
- Dating for 3 months
- Partner gets deployment orders
- Pressure to marry before deployment ("I might die, let's get married")

**Why it's risky:**
- You barely know each other
- Deployment will test even strong relationships
- If relationship can't survive deployment while dating, marriage won't fix it

**Better approach:**
- Date through deployment (test the relationship)
- If you make it through deployment, THEN discuss marriage
- Deployment is relationship filter (shows compatibility)

### üö© Dating Within Chain of Command

**The rules:**
- Officer + Enlisted = Illegal (UCMJ Article 134 - fraternization)
- NCO + Junior Enlisted in same unit = Prohibited
- Same rank = Usually allowed (if not in same chain of command)

**Consequences of fraternization:**
- Court-martial
- Rank reduction
- Discharge
- Both service members punished

**How to date legally:**
- Different units
- Same rank
- No supervisory relationship
- If in doubt, ask JAG

### üö© Ignoring Partner's PTSD/Mental Health

**Reality:**
- 20-30% of combat veterans have PTSD
- Symptoms: Irritability, nightmares, emotional withdrawal
- Untreated PTSD destroys relationships

**What to do:**
- Encourage partner to get help
- Attend couples therapy
- Learn about PTSD (don't take symptoms personally)
- Set boundaries (won't tolerate abuse)
- Know when to leave (if violence/threats)

---

## Long-Distance Relationship Strategies

### Communication Schedule

**Weekly Structure:**
- **Priority #1:** Video call (1x/week, 45-60 min)
- **Daily:** Text check-ins (morning/evening)
- **Weekly:** Longer email or voice message

**Apps that work:**
- WhatsApp (best for international)
- FaceTime (Apple users)
- Facebook Messenger

### Maintaining Connection

**Activities to do "together":**

- Read same book, discuss weekly

**Care packages:**
- Send monthly
- Include photos, letters, favorite snacks
- Shows effort beyond digital

### Setting Expectations

**Discuss BEFORE deployment:**
- Communication frequency (daily texts? Weekly calls?)
- Exclusivity (are you officially dating? Engaged?)
- What if you meet someone else? (Honesty policy)
- Timeline (when will you see each other again?)

## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake #1: Marrying Someone Who Can't Handle Military Life
**Reality:** You marry someone who needs constant attention, can't handle separation, freaks out during deployments.

**Fix:** Date through deployment FIRST. See if they can handle it.

### ‚ùå Mistake #2: Not Discussing Career Sacrifice
**Reality:** You assume spouse will happily follow you. They resent giving up career.

**Fix:** Discuss BEFORE marriage. Spouse career WILL be impacted. Are they okay with that?

### ‚ùå Mistake #3: Ignoring Red Flags Because of BAH
**Reality:** Relationship is rocky, but you get married anyway for BAH. Divorce 2 years later.

**Fix:** Bad relationship + BAH = Still bad relationship (just with more money).

### ‚ùå Mistake #4: Not Establishing Independence
**Reality:** You're together 24/7 when not deployed. Partner has no friends, hobbies, career. Codependent relationship.

**Fix:** Encourage partner to build independent life (friends, career, hobbies). Healthy relationship = two whole people, not two halves.

### ‚ùå Mistake #5: Dating Within Unit (Fraternization)
**Reality:** You date subordinate. Commander finds out. Both get court-martialed.

**Fix:** Don't date within chain of command. Period. Not worth career.
