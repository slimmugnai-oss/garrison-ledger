# Warrant Officer Path: Complete Guide (WO vs. Commissioned Officer)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Warrant Officers (WO) are technical experts (pilots, intel, maintenance, cyber). Pay: Between senior enlisted and officers (WO1: $55K → CW5: $120K). Requires 5-8 years enlisted + specialized MOS + waiver approval + SIFT/board selection. Better if you want technical expertise over command. Commissioned Officers lead large units; Warrants lead specialized teams and advise commanders.

## Common Warrant Officer Questions

### Q: Can I go WO with no college degree?
**A:** Yes! Most WO paths don't require degree. Aviation WO requires only high school diploma + SIFT.

### Q: Is WO better than commissioning as officer?
**A:** Depends on goals. If you want technical mastery (flying, cyber, intel), WO is better. If you want battalion/brigade command, commissioned officer is better.

### Q: Do WOs have to salute officers?
**A:** WOs salute commissioned officers (O-1 and above). Enlisted salute WOs. WO1 is equivalent to O-1 for protocol.

### Q: Can WO become commissioned officer later?
**A:** Rare, but possible (Limited Duty Officer programs). Most WOs stay WO entire career.

### Q: Do WOs outrank senior NCOs?
**A:** Yes. WO1 outranks E-9. But respect and professionalism matter more than rank.

## Common WO Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Applying Too Early
**Reality:** You have 3 years TIS. Apply for aviation WO (requires 5+ years). Denied.

**Fix:** Check specific MOS requirements. Don't apply until you meet ALL requirements.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Weak LORs (Letters of Recommendation)
**Reality:** You get LORs from peers. Board wants letters from officers/CW4+.

**Fix:** Get LORs from people who outrank you and know your work well. 3-5 strong letters.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Poor SIFT Score
**Reality:** You take SIFT without studying. Score 35 (fail). Can't retake for 6 months.

**Fix:** Study 2-4 weeks. Take practice tests. Aim for 50+ (competitive score).

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Staying in Shape
**Reality:** You apply for WO. PT score is 250 (mediocre). Board selects candidate with 290.

**Fix:** Max PT test (or close). Shows discipline and standards.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Thinking WO = "Easier" Than Officer
**Reality:** WO Candidate School is challenging. Flight school is intense. WO jobs are demanding.

**Fix:** WO is different path, not easier path. Prepare accordingly.
