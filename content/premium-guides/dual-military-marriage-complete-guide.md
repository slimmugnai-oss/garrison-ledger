# Dual-Military Marriage: Co-Location, BAH, Deployment & Career Strategy

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Dual-military couples face unique challenges (co-location not guaranteed, dual deployments, career timing) but significant financial benefits (2x BAH = $4,000-$6,000/month, 2x TSP, double retirement). Join Spouse program helps co-location (60-80% success rate). Both can't deploy simultaneously if you have kids (requires Family Care Plan). Communication and career sacrifice planning essential.

## Financial Benefits of Dual-Military Marriage

### BAH (Housing Allowance)

**Scenario 1: No Kids**
- Both get BAH without dependents
- E-5 + E-5 in San Diego: $2,409 + $2,409 = **$4,818/month**
- Rent apartment: $2,500
- **Pocket: $2,318/month ($27,816/year)**

**Scenario 2: With Kids**
- One gets BAH with dependents
- Other gets BAH without dependents
- E-6 ($1,893 with deps) + E-5 ($1,497 without) = **$3,390/month**
- Still better than single military couple

**Scenario 3: Geo-Bachelor (Different Duty Stations)**
- Both get BAH (for separate locations)
- Family Separation Allowance: $250/month
- E-7 (Norfolk) + O-3 (San Diego) = $2,202 + $2,592 = **$4,794/month**
- But paying for 2 households (expensive)

### Retirement (Double Pension)

**Example: Both retire at 20 years**
- E-7: $2,600/month pension
- E-6: $2,100/month pension
- **Combined: $4,700/month = $56,400/year for life**

### TSP (Double Match Under BRS)

**With BRS:**
- E-6 contributes 5%: $175/month match
- O-3 contributes 5%: $300/month match
- **Combined match: $475/month = $5,700/year FREE**

## Co-Location Strategy (Join Spouse Program)

### How Join Spouse Works

**Definition:**
Military attempts to assign married couples to same duty station or within commuting distance.

**Success Rate:**
- 60-80% co-located (varies by branch, MOS)
- Higher success for common career fields
- Lower success for specialized jobs (linguist, EOD, etc.)

### Requirements

**Must:**
- Be legally married
- Both on active duty
- Update DEERS with marriage
- Submit Join Spouse request in assignment system

**Does NOT guarantee:**
- Same base (just "reasonable commuting distance")
- Same timing of PCS
- Same deployment cycle

### Best Practices for Co-Location

**Strategy #1: Choose Common Career Fields**
- Infantry + Supply = Hard to co-locate
- Admin + Medical = Easier (more bases need these)
- IT + IT = Easier (high demand everywhere)

**Strategy #2: Volunteer for Less Desirable Locations**
- Everyone wants San Diego, DC, Hawaii
- Volunteer for Fort Polk, Fort Drum, Fort Irwin = easier co-location

**Strategy #3: Apply Early**
- Submit Join Spouse request 12+ months before PCS window
- Update request every assignment cycle
- Be proactive (don't assume it happens automatically)

**Strategy #4: One Spouse Takes Assignment Control**
- Designate one as "priority" for career
- Other follows (accepts less desirable assignments)
- Alternate who has priority every 3-5 years

## Deployment Coordination

### Family Care Plan (REQUIRED if You Have Kids)

**What it is:**
Legal document designating caregiver if both parents deploy

**Requirements:**
- Must designate short-term caregiver (during deployment prep)
- Must designate long-term caregiver (for deployment duration)
- Caregiver must be able to travel to duty station within 24 hours
- Power of Attorney for caregiver
- Updated every 12 months

**Consequences of not having one:**
- Can't deploy
- Can face UCMJ action
- Could lead to separation from military

### Deployment Coordination Rules

**Policy:**
Both parents cannot deploy simultaneously (in most cases)

**Reality:**
- One deploys, other stays
- Units coordinate to avoid dual deployment
- But not always perfect (especially in high-tempo environments)

**What to do:**
- Communicate with chain of command early
- Request deployment timing coordination
- Have robust Family Care Plan

### Single Deployment Strategies

**Option 1: Stagger Deployments**
- One deploys Jan-July
- Other deploys Aug-Feb (following year)
- Allows one parent home always

**Option 2: One Spouse Takes Non-Deployable Assignment**
- Recruiting duty
- Training instructor
- Staff position
- Reduces dual deployment risk

**Option 3: One Spouse Leaves Active Duty**
- Switch to Reserves/Guard
- Or separate completely
- Guarantees one parent always home

## Career Management (Who Sacrifices?)

### The Hard Truth

**Reality:**
- One career often takes priority
- Other makes sacrifices (assignments, promotions, deployments)
- Resentment builds if not addressed

**Solution:**
- Discuss career goals BEFORE marriage
- Create 5-year plan: whose career takes priority when
- Revisit every PCS cycle

### Common Strategies

**Strategy #1: Alternating Priority**
- Years 1-5: Spouse A's career priority
- Years 6-10: Spouse B's career priority
- Repeat

**Strategy #2: Rank-Based Priority**
- Higher-ranking spouse's career takes priority
- Maximizes family income and retirement

**Strategy #3: One Stays, One Goes**
- One stays active duty (full career)
- Other does 4-10 years, then transitions (GI Bill, civilian career)

**Strategy #4: Both Serve Full Careers**
- Accept geo-bachelor assignments
- Accept non-co-located tours
- Harder on family, but both careers intact

## PCS Challenges for Dual-Military

### Scenario 1: Both PCS, Different Timing

**Problem:**
- Spouse A PCS in June
- Spouse B PCS in November
- Living in 3 locations in 1 year

**Solutions:**
- Request assignment alignment (ask branch managers)
- One spouse requests early/late report date
- Geo-bachelor for 6 months

### Scenario 2: One PCS, Other Can't Co-Locate

**Problem:**
- Spouse A gets orders to Korea (unaccompanied)
- Spouse B can't follow (no Join Spouse slots)

**Solutions:**

- Spouse B requests Korea also (might work)
- Accept 12-month separation

### Scenario 3: Both Get Orders, Different Locations

**Problem:**
- Spouse A: Fort Bragg
- Spouse B: Fort Lewis
- 3,000 miles apart

**Solutions:**
- One spouse requests assignment deletion (rare, hard to get)
- Accept geo-bachelor (expensive, hard on marriage)
- One spouse leaves active duty

- Update waitlist every 3 months

### Family Care Plan Options

**Grandparents:**
- Most common choice
- Must live within travel distance or willing to relocate

**Paid Caregiver:**

## Common Dual-Military Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Submitting Join Spouse Request
**Reality:** You assume military will automatically co-locate you. They don't. You get orders to opposite coasts.

**Fix:** Submit Join Spouse request immediately after marriage. Update every assignment cycle.

### ❌ Mistake #2: No Family Care Plan (With Kids)
**Reality:** You both get deployment orders. No Family Care Plan. Both can't deploy. One faces UCMJ.

**Fix:** Create Family Care Plan within 30 days of having kids (or getting married with kids).

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Discussing Career Sacrifice Before Marriage
**Reality:** You both want to be E-9/O-6. Turns out one has to sacrifice assignments for co-location. Resentment builds.

**Fix:** Have hard conversation BEFORE marriage. Agree on whose career takes priority when.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Using BAH Strategically
**Reality:** You live in expensive apartment. Your combined BAH is $5,000/month. You pay $4,500 rent. You save $500/month.

**Fix:** Live below your BAH. Rent for $3,000. Save $2,000/month = $24,000/year.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Both Deploying (Leaving Kids with Unstable Caregiver)
**Reality:** You designate friend as caregiver. Friend backs out. Kids end up with CPS.

**Fix:** Have solid, reliable, COMMITTED caregiver. Preferably family.

## Dual-Military Divorce (Unique Issues)

### BAH After Divorce

**With kids:**
- Parent with primary custody: BAH with dependents
- Other parent: BAH without dependents

**No kids:**
- Both: BAH without dependents

### Retirement Division

- OR court divides both (rare)

**One retires, one doesn't:**
- Retiring spouse's retirement divided per state law

### Dual PCS After Divorce

**Problem:**
- You're divorced but still dual-military
- Both get PCS orders
- Kids custody arrangement disrupted

**Solution:**
- Court order specifying primary residence
- One spouse requests assignment to stay near kids
