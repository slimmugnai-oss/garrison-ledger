## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

If you're deployed to a designated combat zone, your **entire base pay is tax-free** for every month you spend there - no federal income tax, no state income tax (in most states). For an E-5 earning $3,500/month, that's **~$600/month in tax savings** (~$7,200/year on a 12-month deployment). Officers have a cap ($9,801.90/month for 2025), but enlisted have NO CAP - every dollar of base pay is tax-free.

**This is the single biggest "raise" you'll get in your military career - use it strategically.**

## What is CZTE?

The Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) allows service members serving in designated combat zones to **exclude their base pay from federal taxable income**. This means:

- **No federal income tax** on base pay
- **No state income tax** on base pay (in 44 states that follow federal rules)
- **TSP contributions from combat zone pay are tax-free** (if Roth)
- **SDP (Savings Deposit Program) returns on combat zone savings are tax-free**

### Who Qualifies?

You must be:
- Serving in a **designated combat zone** (IRS-defined)
- On active duty
- Receiving **hostile fire pay (HFP)** or **imminent danger pay (IDP)**

**Common Qualifying Locations (2025):**
- Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria
- Arabian Peninsula (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, UAE, Oman, Jordan)
- Sinai Peninsula (Egypt)
- Djibouti (Africa)
- Yemen, Somalia

**Check your LES:** If you see "HFP" or "IDP" pay, you qualify for CZTE.

## How Much Tax Are You Saving?

### Enlisted: Unlimited Tax-Free Base Pay

**No cap for E-1 through E-9.** Every dollar of base pay earned in a combat zone is tax-free.

**Example: E-5 with 6 Years, 12-Month Deployment**
- Base pay: $3,500/month × 12 months = **$42,000**
- Federal tax bracket: 22%
- **Federal tax savings: ~$9,240**
- State tax (if applicable): ~3-5% = ~$1,260-$2,100
- **Total tax savings: ~$10,500-$11,340**

**Bottom line:** You keep an extra $875-$945/month just from not paying taxes.

### Officers: Cap at $9,801.90/Month (2025)

**Officers (O-1 and above) have a monthly cap** on CZTE. Any base pay above $9,801.90/month is taxable.

**Example: O-4 with 12 Years, 12-Month Deployment**
- Base pay: $8,200/month (below cap)
- **All $8,200/month is tax-free** (no cap issue)
- Annual tax savings: ~$18,000-$20,000

**Example: O-6 with 20 Years, 12-Month Deployment**
- Base pay: $12,500/month (above cap)
- Tax-free: $9,801.90/month
- Taxable: $2,698.10/month
- **Tax savings: ~$26,000** (still massive)

## What's Included in CZTE?

### ✅ Tax-Free (Combat Zone Pay):
- **Base pay** (entire amount for enlisted, capped for officers)
- **Hostile Fire Pay (HFP)** ($225/month)
- **Imminent Danger Pay (IDP)** ($7.50/day or $225/month)
- **Hardship Duty Pay (HDP)** (varies, up to $150/month)
- **Reenlistment bonuses** (if signed in combat zone)
- **Assignment incentive pay** (if deployed)

### ❌ NOT Tax-Free (Always Taxable):
- **BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing)** - Always taxable, even during deployment
- **BAS (Basic Allowance for Subsistence)** - Always taxable
- **Family Separation Allowance (FSA)** - Taxable
- **Per diem** - Taxable
- **Special pays not tied to combat zone** - Taxable

## Strategic CZTE Moves to Maximize Savings

### Strategy 1: Max TSP Contributions During Deployment

**Why:** TSP contributions from combat zone pay are **tax-exempt going in** AND **tax-exempt coming out** (if Roth).

**Normal TSP:**
- You contribute $1,000 to Roth TSP from taxable income
- Cost: $1,000 + ~$220 in taxes = **$1,220 out of pocket**
- Retirement: Withdraw $5,000 tax-free (after growth)

**Combat Zone TSP:**
- You contribute $1,000 to Roth TSP from combat zone pay
- Cost: **$1,000 out of pocket** (no taxes!)
- Retirement: Withdraw $5,000 tax-free (after growth)

**Savings: $220 per $1,000 contributed** (22% tax bracket)

**Action Plan:**
- Increase TSP contribution to 50-75% during deployment
- You're living on base, expenses are minimal, BAH keeps flowing to family
- Max annual contribution: $23,500 (2025) or $30,500 if over 50

**Example: E-6 Deployed for 12 Months**
- Normal TSP: 10% ($400/month) = $4,800/year
- Deployment TSP: 50% ($2,000/month) = $24,000/year
- **Extra $19,200 invested** during deployment
- **Tax savings: ~$4,224** (22% bracket)
- **Future value (30 years at 9%): ~$254,000**

### Strategy 2: Combine CZTE + SDP for Double Tax Benefit

**Why:** SDP returns on combat zone savings are also tax-free.

**Normal Investment:**
- Invest $10,000 in taxable account
- Earn $1,000 return (10%)
- Pay ~$220 tax on gains (22% bracket)
- **Net gain: $780**

**Combat Zone SDP:**
- Deposit $10,000 in SDP (from combat zone pay)
- Earn $1,291 return (10% compounded over 12 months + 90 days)
- **Pay $0 tax**
- **Net gain: $1,291**

**Action Plan:**
1. Max SDP first ($10,000)
2. Then max TSP ($23,500)
3. If you still have income left, save for emergency fund

### Strategy 3: Time Your Reenlistment Bonus

**Why:** Reenlistment bonuses signed in a combat zone are tax-free.

**Scenario:**
- Reenlistment bonus: $30,000
- Signed CONUS: Pay ~$6,600 in taxes (22% bracket) = **Net $23,400**
- Signed in combat zone: Pay **$0 taxes** = **Net $30,000**

**Action Plan:**
- If your reenlistment window opens before/during deployment, **wait to sign in the combat zone**
- Timing = $6,600 saved

**Caveat:** Don't delay if you risk missing your window. Check with retention NCO.

### Strategy 4: Extend Your Deployment (If Safe & Worth It)

**Why:** Every additional month in a combat zone = more tax-free income.

**Math:**
- E-5 base pay: $3,500/month
- Tax savings: ~$770/month (22% bracket)
- **Extra 3 months deployed = $2,310 more in your pocket**

**Considerations:**
- Family separation toll (money isn't everything)
- Mission/unit needs
- Deployment fatigue
- Safety

**Bottom line:** If you're comfortable and the mission is stable, an extra 90 days can fund a nice post-deployment vacation.

## How CZTE Works on Your LES

### What You'll See:

**Month 1 (Pre-Deployment):**
```
Base Pay:     $3,500.00
FITW (Fed):   -$385.00 (11% bracket)
State Tax:    -$105.00 (3%)
Net:          $3,010.00
```

**Month 2 (In Combat Zone):**
```
Base Pay:     $3,500.00
HFP:          +$225.00
CZTE:         ($3,725.00)  ← Tax-exempt amount shown
FITW (Fed):   $0.00
State Tax:    $0.00
Net:          $3,725.00
```

**Difference: $715/month more in your pocket**

### LES Codes:

- **CZTE**: Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (shows amount excluded)
- **HFP**: Hostile Fire Pay ($225/month)
- **IDP**: Imminent Danger Pay ($225/month)
- **FITW**: Federal Income Tax Withheld ($0 during deployment)

## Filing Taxes After Deployment

### Do You Still Need to File?

**YES.** Even though your combat pay is tax-free, you still must file a tax return if:
- You earned non-combat income (pre/post deployment months)
- You had BAH/BAS/FSA (always taxable)
- You want to claim refunds or credits

### What to Report:

**Box 1 (Wages) on W-2:**
- Shows **total income MINUS combat zone pay**
- If you deployed all year, Box 1 might show $0 or very low amount

**Box 12 (Code Q):**
- Shows **total non-taxable combat pay**
- This is for your records, not added to taxable income

**Example W-2 (E-5 Deployed All Year):**
```
Box 1 (Taxable wages):  $15,000 (BAH only)
Box 12 Code Q:          $42,000 (Combat zone base pay)
```

### Common Mistake:

**❌ Forgetting to file because Box 1 is low**

Even if your taxable income is minimal, file to:
- Claim refunds (if you had withholding before deployment)
- Claim Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) if eligible
- Avoid IRS notices

### Using Military Tax Software:

**Free options:**
- **MilTax** (free for all military, covers complex situations)
- **TurboTax Military** (free for E-1 to E-5)
- **H&R Block Military** (free)

All three handle CZTE automatically if your W-2 is correct.

## Real-World Example: E-5 12-Month Deployment

**Profile:**
- Rank: E-5 with 6 years
- Base Pay: $3,500/month
- BAH: $1,773/month (Fort Hood, with dependents)
- Deployment: 12 months in Kuwait
- Family: Spouse + 2 kids

### Income Breakdown:

**Combat Zone Pay (Tax-Free):**
- Base pay: $3,500/month × 12 = $42,000
- HFP: $225/month × 12 = $2,700
- **Total tax-free: $44,700**

**Taxable Pay:**
- BAH: $1,773/month × 12 = $21,276
- BAS: $460/month × 12 = $5,520
- FSA: $250/month × 12 = $3,000
- **Total taxable: $29,796**

### Tax Savings:

**Without CZTE (normal year):**
- Total income: $42,000 + $29,796 = $71,796
- Federal tax: ~$7,800 (12-22% brackets)
- State tax: ~$2,150 (3%)
- **Total taxes: ~$9,950**

**With CZTE (deployment year):**
- Taxable income: $29,796 (only BAH/BAS/FSA)
- Federal tax: ~$1,200 (10-12% brackets)
- State tax: ~$890 (3%)
- **Total taxes: ~$2,090**

**Tax Savings: $7,860**

### What to Do with $7,860?

**Option A: Max SDP**
- Deposit $10,000 in SDP
- Earn $1,291 interest (tax-free)
- **Total: $11,291**

**Option B: Max TSP**
- Contribute $23,500 to Roth TSP (tax-free)
- Future value (30 years at 9%): **$311,000**

**Option C: Pay Off Debt**
- Eliminate $7,860 in credit card debt
- Save ~$1,600/year in interest (20% APR)

**Smart Move:** Max SDP first, then TSP, then debt.

## Common Mistakes That Cost Money

### Mistake #1: Not Adjusting TSP Contributions

**Problem:** Deploy with 5% TSP, miss opportunity to invest tax-free income.

**Cost:** E-5 could have contributed $19,200 more during 12 months, future value = $254,000.

**Fix:** Increase TSP to 50-75% as soon as you arrive in combat zone.

### Mistake #2: California Residents Not Filing Form FTB 3913

**Problem:** CA doesn't automatically follow federal CZTE. If you don't file the form, CA taxes your combat pay.

**Cost:** E-5 with $42,000 combat pay = ~$4,200 in unnecessary CA state tax (10% bracket).

**Fix:** File CA Form FTB 3913 every year you have combat zone income.

### Mistake #3: Signing Reenlistment Bonus Before Deployment

**Problem:** Sign in April, deploy in June. Bonus is taxable.

**Cost:** $30,000 bonus = $6,600 in taxes.

**Fix:** If your reenlistment window allows, sign IN the combat zone.

### Mistake #4: Not Maxing SDP

**Problem:** Only deposit $5,000 in SDP when you could afford $10,000.

**Cost:** Miss out on $645 in guaranteed 10% interest (on the other $5,000).

**Fix:** Max SDP first, THEN save elsewhere.

### Mistake #5: Forgetting to File Taxes

**Problem:** Think "my income was tax-free, no need to file."

**Cost:** Miss refunds, trigger IRS notices, complicate future returns.

**Fix:** Always file, even if Box 1 on W-2 is $0.
