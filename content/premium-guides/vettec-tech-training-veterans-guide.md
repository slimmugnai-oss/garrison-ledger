## Common VET TEC Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Applying Because "I'm Not Tech-Savvy"

**Reality:**
- "I don't know how to code, I can't do bootcamp"
- Doesn't apply

**Truth:**
- Bootcamps designed for beginners
- No prior experience required (teach from scratch)

**Fix:** Apply anyway (bootcamp teaches everything)

### ❌ Mistake #2: Choosing Program Based on Hype (Not Outcomes)

**Reality:**

- Doesn't research job placement rates
- Completes program, can't find job

**Fix:** Research placement rates (70%+ = good), alumni reviews, employer partnerships

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Taking It Seriously (Because It's Free)

**Reality:**
- Free tuition = "I'll just try it, no pressure"
- Doesn't put in effort
- Fails out or doesn't get job

**Fix:** Treat like paid bootcamp (study 40-60 hours/week, do all assignments, engage fully)

### ❌ Mistake #4: Forgetting BAH Is Taxable

**Reality:**
- Receive $3,000/month BAH
- Spend all of it
- Tax time: Owe $2,000 (didn't withhold taxes)

**Fix:** Set aside 15-20% for taxes OR adjust withholding

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Using GI Bill After VET TEC

**Reality:**
- Complete VET TEC, get job
- Never use GI Bill (expires 15 years after separation)
