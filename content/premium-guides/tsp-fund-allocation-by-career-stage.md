# TSP Fund Allocation Strategy: By Career Stage & Risk Tolerance

**Bottom Line Up Front:** If you're under 40, put 100% in the C Fund (stocks). If you're 40-50, use the L 2060 or L 2065 Lifecycle fund. If you're within 10 years of retirement, shift to L Income or L 2030. The G Fund is almost always a mistake for long-term growth.

## The Five TSP Funds Explained

### G Fund (Government Securities)
- **What it is:** Short-term US Treasury securities
- **Return:** ~2-3% annually (barely beats inflation)

**Real Performance (2015-2024):**
- Average annual return: 2.4%
- $10,000 invested in 2015 = $12,656 in 2024
- Purchasing power after inflation: **$10,800** (lost money to inflation!)

### F Fund (Fixed Income / Bonds)
- **What it is:** US bond market index
- **Return:** ~3-5% annually
- **Risk:** Low to moderate (can lose value when rates rise)

**Real Performance (2015-2024):**
- Average annual return: 1.1% (negative in 2022!)
- $10,000 invested in 2015 = $11,157 in 2024

## The Lifecycle (L) Funds

### What Are They?
Pre-mixed portfolios that automatically adjust as you age, becoming more conservative over time.

### Available L Funds (2025):
- **L 2070** (retire around 2070) - 99% stocks, 1% bonds
- **L 2065** (retire around 2065) - 99% stocks, 1% bonds
- **L 2060** (retire around 2060) - 99% stocks, 1% bonds
- **L 2055** (retire around 2055) - 95% stocks, 5% bonds
- **L 2050** (retire around 2050) - 88% stocks, 12% bonds
- **L 2045** (retire around 2045) - 79% stocks, 21% bonds
- **L 2040** (retire around 2040) - 70% stocks, 30% bonds
- **L 2035** (retire around 2035) - 60% stocks, 40% bonds
- **L 2030** (retire around 2030) - 50% stocks, 50% bonds
- **L Income** (already retired or retiring soon) - 26% stocks, 74% bonds/G Fund

### Pros of L Funds:
- ✅ Automatic rebalancing (you don't have to do anything)
- ✅ Instant diversification across all 5 funds
- ✅ "Set it and forget it" simplicity
- ✅ No management fees beyond normal TSP fees

### Cons of L Funds:
- ❌ Too conservative for young investors (includes bonds too early)
- ❌ Includes the low-performing G and F Funds
- ❌ Less control over exact allocation

## By Rank & Age Recommendations

### E-1 to E-4 (Age 18-25)
**Recommendation: 100% C Fund**

**Why:**
- You have 40-50 years until retirement
- You can ride out market crashes
- The C Fund's 10-11% return will compound massively
- Even a 50% crash recovers within 3-5 years

**Alternative:** 80% C Fund, 20% S Fund (for aggressive growth)

**Real Example:**
- E-3 contributing $200/month to 100% C Fund for 40 years
- At 10% annual return: **$1,058,000** at retirement
- Same contribution to G Fund (2.4%): **$186,000** 
- **Difference: $872,000!**

### E-5 to E-6 (Age 25-35)
**Recommendation: 90% C Fund, 10% S Fund**

**Why:**
- Still 30-40 years to retirement
- Adding S Fund for small-cap exposure
- Time to recover from volatility
- Maximize growth while you can

**Alternative:** L 2060 or L 2065 Lifecycle Fund (if you want simplicity)

### E-7 to E-9 (Age 35-45)
**Recommendation:** 
- **If 15+ years to retirement:** 80% C Fund, 10% S Fund, 10% I Fund
- **If 10-15 years to retirement:** L 2045 or L 2050

**Why:**
- Still time for growth, but adding some diversification
- International (I Fund) reduces concentration risk
- Can start using L Funds if retirement is approaching

### O-1 to O-3 (Age 22-32)
**Recommendation: 100% C Fund or 80% C / 20% S**

**Why:**
- Same as junior enlisted — you're young
- Maximize long-term growth
- Don't be afraid of volatility

### O-4 to O-6 (Age 35-50)
**Recommendation:**
- **If 20+ years to retirement:** 80% C, 10% S, 10% I
- **If 10-20 years to retirement:** L 2040 to L 2050
- **If <10 years to retirement:** L 2030 to L 2040

**Why:**
- Balancing growth with stability
- You likely have a larger TSP balance to protect
- L Funds provide automatic glide path to retirement

### Within 5 Years of Retirement (Any Rank)
**Recommendation: L Income or L 2030**

**Why:**
- Protecting your balance from major crashes
- Still need SOME growth (you'll live 20-30 years in retirement)
- Balanced approach between stability and growth

## The "G Fund Trap" Warning

**THE BIGGEST TSP MISTAKE:**

### Why the G Fund Feels Safe (But Isn't)
- You see steady growth every month
- It never goes down
- It feels "responsible"

### Why the G Fund Is Actually Risky
- **Inflation risk:** You're losing purchasing power
- **Opportunity cost:** Missing out on 8-10% annual growth
- **Compounding loss:** Over 30 years, this costs you $500,000+

### The Math:
| **Fund** | **$500/month for 30 years** | **Total Contribution** | **Final Balance** | **Lost Opportunity** |
|----------|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| G Fund (2.4%) | $180,000 | $180,000 | $260,000 | — |
| C Fund (10%) | $180,000 | $180,000 | **$1,130,000** | **$870,000!** |

**Conclusion:** The G Fund "feels safe" but costs you $870,000 in this example. That's not safe — that's devastating.

### When G Fund Is Acceptable:
- ✅ Money you need within 1-2 years (emergency fund held in TSP)
- ✅ You're already retired and drawing down
- ✅ You're moving money OUT of TSP to rollover to IRA (temporary hold)

**That's it. If you're 10+ years from retirement, the G Fund is a mistake.**

## Rebalancing Strategy

### What Is Rebalancing?
Selling some of your winners and buying more of your losers to maintain your target allocation.

### Example:
- You start with 80% C Fund, 20% S Fund
- C Fund grows faster → now 85% C, 15% S
- Rebalance by selling 5% C and buying 5% S → back to 80/20

### How Often Should You Rebalance?
- **If using L Funds:** Never. They auto-rebalance quarterly.
- **If using individual funds:** Once per year (set a calendar reminder)
- **During market crashes:** DON'T rebalance emotionally. Stick to your plan.

### TSP Rebalancing Tool:
1. Log into TSP.gov
2. Go to "Contribution Allocations"
3. Click "Rebalance Account"
4. Confirm your target allocation
5. Done!

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: "I'm too scared of the stock market, so I use the G Fund"
**Reality:** Over 30 years, the stock market has NEVER had a negative return. Even including the 2008 crash. Fear is costing you your retirement.

### ❌ Mistake #2: "I put everything in the L Fund that matches my birth year"
**Reality:** L Funds are designed for your RETIREMENT year, not your birth year. An E-4 born in 1995 who retires in 2045 should use L 2045, not L 2065.

### ❌ Mistake #3: "I'll move to the G Fund when the market is about to crash"
**Reality:** No one can time the market. You'll sell at the bottom and buy at the top, losing money. Studies show market timers underperform buy-and-hold by 3-5% annually.

### ❌ Mistake #4: "I'll split my contributions evenly across all 5 funds for diversification"
**Reality:** That's not diversification, that's dilution. The C Fund already contains 500 companies. Adding G Fund (2.4% return) drags down your 10% return to 6-7%.

### ❌ Mistake #5: "I'll switch funds every time I hear market news"
**Reality:** Trading costs you. TSP allows 2 interfund transfers per month, but frequent trading is proven to reduce returns by 2-3% annually.

## Action Steps

### Step 1: Determine Your Retirement Timeline

- Be honest about your risk tolerance
- When in doubt, go more aggressive (you can always reduce later)

### Step 3: Update Your TSP
1. Log into TSP.gov
2. Go to "Contribution Allocations"
3. Choose your funds
4. Apply to BOTH "Contribution Allocation" (new money) AND "Interfund Transfer" (existing balance)
5. Save

### Step 4: Set Annual Review Reminder
- Review allocation once per year
- Adjust if you get promoted, change career plans, or approach retirement
- Otherwise, LEAVE IT ALONE
