## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

A **DITY (Do-It-Yourself) Move**, now officially called PPM (Personally Procured Move), lets you pocket the difference between what the military would pay movers and what you actually spend. With smart planning, most service members clear **$2,000-$5,000 profit** on a CONUS PCS move.

**The military pays you 100% of what they WOULD have paid a moving company - if you spend less, you keep the difference.**

---

## What is a DITY/PPM Move?

Instead of letting the military arrange your move (GHC - Government-arranged Household Goods move), YOU handle it yourself and get paid a percentage of what the military would have spent.

### Key Numbers:
- **Government Pays:** 100% of the "GCC" (Government Constructed Cost) - what it would cost the military to move your stuff
- **You Keep:** Whatever you don't spend moving yourself
- **Tax Treatment:** Profits are taxable income (but you can deduct expenses)

### Example Scenario:
- **Government Cost:** $8,000 (to move 8,000 lbs from Fort Hood to Fort Lewis)
- **Your Actual Cost:** $5,000 (truck rental, gas, helpers, boxes)
- **Your Profit:** **$3,000** (taxable, but worth it)

---

## Why Do a DITY Move?

### Pros:
- ✅ **Profit:** Clear $2,000-$5,000 on average
- ✅ **Control:** You decide what gets loaded, when, and how carefully
- ✅ **Flexibility:** Move on your timeline, not the movers' schedule
- ✅ **No Lost Items:** Your stuff stays with you (no mysterious disappearances)
- ✅ **Advance Payment:** Get 60% of estimated reimbursement UP FRONT

### Cons:
- ❌ **Labor-Intensive:** You're doing the packing, loading, driving, unloading
- ❌ **Risk:** If truck breaks down or you get injured, it's on you
- ❌ **Tax Complexity:** Profit is taxable income (but expenses are deductible)
- ❌ **Weight Ticket Hassle:** You must get certified weight tickets (mess this up = no pay)

**Bottom Line:** If you're young, fit, and motivated by money, DITY is a no-brainer. If you have 10,000+ lbs and a bad back, maybe not.

---

## How DITY Move Reimbursement Works

### Step 1: Calculate Government Cost (GCC)
The military calculates what it would cost THEM to move your stuff via a contracted moving company. This is based on:
- **Weight:** Your authorized weight allowance (based on rank and dependents)
- **Distance:** Miles from origin to destination
- **Current Rates:** GSA mileage rates (updated annually)

**You can estimate this using the DPS (Defense Personal Property System) estimator at move.mil.**

### Step 2: Get Your Advance (60%)
You can request an **advance payment** of up to **60% of the estimated GCC** BEFORE your move.

**Why this matters:**
- You get cash up front to rent truck, buy gas, hire help
- It's an advance, not a gift - you settle up after the move
- If you spend less than 60%, you keep the difference
- If you spend more than 60% (but less than 100%), you get reimbursed for the rest

### Step 3: Execute Your Move
You handle everything:
- Rent U-Haul/Penske/Budget truck
- Buy packing supplies
- Load truck (yourself or hire help)
- Drive to new duty station
- Unload truck
- Return truck

### Step 4: Get Certified Weight Tickets
**THIS IS CRITICAL - DON'T MESS THIS UP.**

You MUST get **2 certified weight tickets** at a CAT scale (truck stop, landfill, recycling center):
1. **Full Weight:** Truck loaded with all your stuff
2. **Empty Weight:** Truck empty (after unloading)

**Difference = Net Weight = What you moved = What you get paid for**

**PRO TIP:** Get your empty weight ticket at your ORIGIN (before loading). Drive to the CAT scale, get empty weight, THEN go home and load. This saves you from having to unload and weigh again at destination.

### Step 5: Submit Receipts and Get Paid
After your move, you submit:
- Weight tickets (certified, stamped, signed)
- Receipts for truck rental, gas, tolls, packing supplies, hired help
- DD Form 2278 (Application for DITY Move Payment)
- Travel voucher in DTS (Defense Travel System)

**Timeline:**
- Submit within **45 days** of move completion
- Payment typically arrives **30-60 days** after submission
- If you got the 60% advance, you'll receive the remaining 40% (minus any overage)

## Maximizing Your DITY Move Profit

### Strategy 1: Rent the Smallest Truck Possible
**Why:** Smaller truck = cheaper rental + better gas mileage = more profit

**Example:**
- 26-foot U-Haul: $1,500 rental + $800 gas = **$2,300**
- 20-foot U-Haul: $1,000 rental + $500 gas = **$1,500**
- **Savings:** $800 more profit just by downsizing

**Pro Tip:** Do a trial pack in your garage. Measure what you ACTUALLY need to move vs. what you think you need. Most people overestimate truck size by 30%.

### Strategy 2: Move During Off-Peak Season
**Why:** Truck rental prices SKYROCKET during peak PCS season (May-August)

**Example:**
- **June** (peak): 26-foot U-Haul = $2,000+
- **October** (off-peak): Same truck = $1,000-1,200
- **Savings:** $800-1,000 more profit

**Reality Check:** You don't always control PCS timing, but if you have a window, avoid June-July.

### Strategy 3: Get Multiple Weight Tickets
**Why:** The more weight you move, the more you get paid

**What Counts as "Weight":**
- Household goods (furniture, boxes, appliances)
- **PRO (Professional Gear):** Tools, uniforms, military equipment (separate weight allowance)
- **Car on a trailer:** If you tow your POV (Privately Owned Vehicle), that weight counts

**Example:**
- Household goods: 7,000 lbs
- POV on trailer: 3,500 lbs
- **Total:** 10,500 lbs (you get paid for all of it)

**Pro Tip:** Towing your car instead of driving it separately can add $500-1,000 to your reimbursement.

### Strategy 4: DIY Packing & Hire Labor Smart
**Why:** Packing yourself is free. Hiring movers for loading/unloading only is cheap.

**Cost Comparison:**
- **Full-service movers:** $3,000-5,000 (pack, load, drive, unload)
- **U-Haul + DIY pack + hired labor (load/unload only):** $1,500-2,000
- **Savings:** $1,500-3,000 more profit

**Where to Find Cheap Labor:**
- **College kids:** $20-30/hr per person (Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist)
- **Moving labor services:** HireAHelper.com, TaskRabbit
- **Junior enlisted buddies:** Case of beer + pizza (free, but you owe them next PCS)

**Pro Tip:** Hire 3-4 strong guys for 3 hours to load the truck. You drive. Hire 3-4 guys at destination to unload. Total cost: $300-500. Total value: Priceless (your back will thank you).

### Strategy 5: Max Your Weight Allowance
**Why:** You get paid based on weight moved, not weight you're authorized to move

**Weight Allowances by Rank (without dependents):**
- E-1 to E-5: 7,000 lbs
- E-6 to E-9: 11,000 lbs
- O-1 to O-3: 12,000 lbs
- O-4 to O-6: 14,000 lbs

**With dependents:** Add 1,000-2,000 lbs

**Reality Check:** If you're authorized 10,000 lbs but only move 6,000 lbs, you're leaving money on the table. Fill that truck (legally).

### Strategy 6: Keep EVERY Receipt
**Why:** Expenses reduce your taxable profit

**Deductible Expenses:**
- Truck rental
- Gas receipts
- Tolls
- Packing supplies (boxes, tape, bubble wrap)
- Hired labor (movers, loaders)
- Equipment rental (dollies, straps, pads)
- Lodging during drive (if multi-day move)

**Tax Math:**
- Gross reimbursement: $8,000
- Actual expenses: $5,000
- Taxable profit: $3,000
- After-tax profit (22% tax bracket): ~$2,340

**Pro Tip:** Use a dedicated folder/envelope for ALL receipts. Lose a receipt = can't deduct it = higher taxes.

## Real-World Example: E-5 PCS from Fort Hood to Fort Lewis

### Profile:
- **Rank:** E-5 with 6 years
- **Dependents:** Spouse + 2 kids
- **Weight Allowance:** 9,000 lbs
- **Distance:** 2,200 miles (Fort Hood, TX → Fort Lewis, WA)

### Government Cost Estimate (GCC):
- **Weight:** 8,500 lbs (close to max)
- **Distance:** 2,200 miles
- **GCC:** **$8,500** (military's cost to move via contractor)

### DITY Move Plan:
1. **Advance Payment (60%):** $5,100 (received 10 days before move)
2. **Truck Rental:** 26-foot Penske, 7-day rental = **$1,800**
3. **Gas:** 2,200 miles ÷ 10 mpg × $4/gallon = **$880**
4. **Packing Supplies:** 50 boxes, tape, bubble wrap = **$200**
5. **Hired Labor (Load):** 3 guys × 3 hours × $25/hr = **$225**
6. **Hired Labor (Unload):** 3 guys × 3 hours × $25/hr = **$225**
7. **Lodging:** 3 nights × $80/night = **$240** (reimbursable via TLE/TLA)
8. **Tolls:** **$50**

### Total Expenses: **$3,620**

### Final Settlement:
- **GCC (Total Reimbursement):** $8,500
- **Advance Received:** $5,100
- **Remaining Owed:** $3,400 (paid after move)
- **Total Received:** $8,500
- **Total Spent:** $3,620
- **Net Profit:** **$4,880**

### After Taxes:
- **Taxable Income:** $4,880
- **Tax (22% bracket):** ~$1,074
- **After-Tax Profit:** **$3,806**

**Bottom Line:** This E-5 netted almost **$4,000** for driving a truck across the country. Not bad for a week's work.

## Common Mistakes That Cost You Money

### Mistake #1: No Weight Tickets
**Problem:** Forget to get certified weight tickets or lose them.  
**Cost:** **$0 reimbursement** (no weight tickets = no proof = no pay).  
**Fix:** Get 2 tickets (full + empty). Take photos. Store in 3 places (physical, email, cloud).

### Mistake #2: Wrong Type of Weight Ticket
**Problem:** Get a receipt from a truck stop scale, but it's not "certified."  
**Cost:** Rejected claim, delayed payment, or reduced reimbursement.  
**Fix:** Use a **CAT scale** (Certified Automated Truck scale) at truck stops, recycling centers, or landfills. Look for the CAT logo.

### Mistake #3: Overestimating Truck Size
**Problem:** Rent a 26-foot truck when a 20-foot would work.  
**Cost:** $500-1,000 in unnecessary rental and gas costs.  
**Fix:** Do a trial pack in your garage. Measure. Downsize.

### Mistake #4: Missing the 45-Day Deadline
**Problem:** Submit paperwork 60 days after move completion.  
**Cost:** Claim denied or requires commander waiver (pain in the ass).  
**Fix:** Submit within 45 days. Set a calendar reminder for Day 30.

### Mistake #5: Not Keeping Receipts
**Problem:** Lose receipts, can't deduct expenses.  
**Cost:** Higher taxable income = higher taxes (easily $500-1,000 more in taxes).  
**Fix:** Dedicated envelope/folder. Snap photos with your phone. Email receipts to yourself.

### Mistake #6: Ignoring PRO Gear
**Problem:** Forget to weigh professional gear separately.  
**Cost:** Miss out on extra $300-500 reimbursement.  
**Fix:** Weigh PRO gear separately (tools, uniforms, military equipment). It has its own allowance and doesn't count against household goods weight.
