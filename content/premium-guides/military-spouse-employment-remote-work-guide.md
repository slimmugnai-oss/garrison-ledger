# Military Spouse Employment: Remote Work, Portable Careers & MyCAA Funding

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Military spouse unemployment 21% (vs. 3-4% national average). PCS every 2-3 years disrupts careers. Solution: Portable careers (remote work, licensure reciprocity, entrepreneurship). Best options: Tech (coding, UX design), healthcare (nursing, physical therapy), education (teaching, tutoring), virtual assistance. MyCAA = $4,000 free training for portable careers (E-1 to E-5 spouses only). Remote work: 60% of companies now offer remote positions (post-COVID boom). Licensure: Interstate compacts for nurses, teachers, counselors (work across state lines). Spouse preference hiring: Government jobs give preference to military spouses.

## Why Military Spouse Employment Is Hard

### The PCS Problem

**Typical career disruption:**
- Build career in Texas (2 years)
- PCS to North Carolina (start over)
- Build career in NC (3 years)
- PCS to Germany (international = career break)
- Return from Germany (4 years gap, start over again)

**Result:** Never build seniority, always entry-level, income stagnates

**Income impact:**
- Average spouse without portable career: $20K-$35K/year (entry-level, frequent job changes)
- Average spouse with portable career: $40K-$80K/year (experience compounds)

### Licensing Issues

**State-specific licenses (non-portable):**
- Teaching (need license in each state)
- Cosmetology (need state license)
- Real estate (state license)
- Counseling/social work (state license)
- Nursing (some states, though interstate compact now exists)

**Problem:**
- Get licensed in Texas ($500, 6 months process)
- PCS to Florida
- License doesn't transfer
- Pay $500 + 6 months to get Florida license
- Repeat every PCS

**Solution:** Interstate compacts OR fully remote work
