# VA Disability Claims: Complete Step-by-Step Guide (2025)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** VA disability provides tax-free monthly compensation (10%-100% ratings: $171-$3,737/month) for service-connected conditions. File while still on active duty (BDD program = faster processing). Need: Current diagnosis + in-service event/injury + nexus linking them. Claims take 3-12 months. Use VSO (free) for help. Most veterans underrate conditions - file for EVERYTHING.

## The Three Requirements for Service Connection

### 1. Current Diagnosis
**Need:**
- Medical diagnosis from doctor/therapist
- Can be from VA provider OR private provider
- Must be documented in medical records

**Example conditions:**
- PTSD
- Hearing loss
- Knee injury
- Sleep apnea
- Back pain
- Tinnitus (ringing in ears)

### 2. In-Service Event or Injury
**Need:**
- Event happened during military service
- Documented in service medical records (SMRs)
- OR buddy statements if not documented

**Examples:**
- Combat exposure → PTSD
- Loud noise exposure → hearing loss
- Parachute landing → knee injury
- Burn pit exposure → respiratory issues

### 3. Nexus (Link Between #1 and #2)
**Need:**
- Doctor's opinion linking current condition to service
- "Nexus letter" or IMO (Independent Medical Opinion)
- Can be from VA C&P examiner OR private doctor

**Example nexus statement:**
> "It is my medical opinion that the veteran's current PTSD is at least as likely as not (50% or more) caused by combat exposure during deployment to Iraq in 2008."

## How to File VA Disability Claim (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Gather Evidence (Start 6-12 Months Before Separation)

**Documents needed:**
1. DD-214 (discharge paperwork)
2. Service medical records (SMRs) - get from VA or via ebenefits.va.gov
3. Private medical records (if you saw civilian doctors)
4. Buddy statements (for combat-related claims)
5. Marriage certificate (if claiming spouse/dependent benefits)

**Buddy statement template:**
```
I, [Name], [Rank], served with [Veteran's Name] in [Unit] from [Dates]. I witnessed [event/injury]. Specifically, I observed [details]. Since that time, I've noticed [symptoms/changes in veteran]. This statement is true to the best of my knowledge.

Signed: [Name], [Date], [Contact Info]
```

### Step 2: File Claim Online

**Go to VA.gov:**
1. Create account (verify identity via ID.me)
2. Click "File a Claim"
3. Select "File for Disability Compensation"
4. Fill out VA Form 21-526EZ

**Claim what:**
- List ALL conditions (even "minor" ones)
- Don't self-rate (let VA rate you)
- Include mental health (PTSD, anxiety, depression)

### Step 3: Attend C&P Exam (Compensation & Pension)

**What happens:**
- VA schedules exam with contracted examiner
- Usually 1-2 months after filing claim
- Examiner evaluates each claimed condition
- Writes report for VA rater

**How to prepare:**
- Bring all medical records
- Be honest (don't exaggerate, but don't minimize)
- Describe WORST days, not best days
- Explain how condition affects daily life

**Example answers:**

**Bad:** "My knee hurts sometimes."  
**Good:** "My knee pain is 6/10 daily. It prevents me from running, playing with my kids, or standing for more than 30 minutes. I wake up 3 times per night due to pain. I take 800mg ibuprofen 3x/day just to function."

### Step 4: Wait for Decision (3-12 Months)

**Timeline:**
- BDD (Benefits Delivery at Discharge): 60-90 days
- Standard claim: 3-6 months
- Complex claim: 6-12+ months

**Check status:**
- VA.gov (claim status tracker)
- eBenefits.va.gov
- Call VA: 800-827-1000

### Step 5: Review Decision Letter

**VA sends:**
- Rating decision letter
- Breakdown of each condition
- Effective date
- Monthly payment amount

**If approved:**
- Payments start within 30 days
- Backpay from effective date (usually date of filing)

**If denied:**
- You can appeal (see below)

## How to Increase Your VA Rating

### File for More Conditions

**Common missed claims:**
- Tinnitus (ringing in ears) - almost all vets qualify
- Sleep apnea - if you snore loudly
- Mental health (PTSD, depression, anxiety)
- Back pain, neck pain, knee pain
- Hearing loss
- Migraines/headaches

**Each condition rated separately:**
- 10% for tinnitus
- 50% for sleep apnea
- 70% for PTSD
- 20% for knee injury
- **Combined: 90%+ possible** (VA uses combined ratings table, not simple addition)

### File Secondary Claims

**What it is:**
Condition caused by already service-connected condition

**Examples:**
- PTSD (service-connected) → Depression (secondary to PTSD)
- Knee injury (service-connected) → Back pain (secondary to compensating for bad knee)
- Sleep apnea (service-connected) → GERD (secondary to CPAP use)

### Request Increase (If Condition Worsens)

**When to file:**
- Condition has worsened since original rating
- New symptoms developed
- Requires more treatment

**Process:**
1. File "Claim for Increase" (VA Form 21-526EZ)
2. Provide updated medical evidence
3. Attend new C&P exam
4. Wait for decision

**Warning:** VA can reduce rating if examiner finds improvement (rare, but possible)

## Common VA Claim Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Filing Before Separation
**Reality:** You separate. File claim 6 months later. Wait another 6 months for decision. 12 months with no VA income.

**Fix:** File BDD 90-180 days before separation. Get rating immediately.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Claiming "Minor" Conditions
**Reality:** You think tinnitus isn't worth claiming. Later find out it's automatic 10% = $171/month = $2,052/year for life.

**Fix:** Claim EVERYTHING. Let VA decide what's ratable.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Downplaying Symptoms at C&P Exam
**Reality:** Examiner asks "How's your knee?" You say "It's fine." Get 0% rating.

**Fix:** Describe worst days. Explain how condition affects daily life. Be honest, thorough.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Using VSO (Veterans Service Officer)
**Reality:** You file claim alone. Get denied. Don't know why. Don't know how to appeal.

**Fix:** Use free VSO (DAV, VFW, American Legion). They know the system.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Filing for Mental Health
**Reality:** You have PTSD, depression, anxiety. Don't claim them (stigma). Miss out on 70%+ rating.

**Fix:** Mental health conditions are service-connected. File for them. 50-70% of combat veterans qualify.
