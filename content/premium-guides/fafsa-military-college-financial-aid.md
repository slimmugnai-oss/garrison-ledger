# FAFSA for Military: Financial Aid, Dependency Status & Maximizing College Money

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Military members file FAFSA as independent students (even if young) = more financial aid eligibility. GI Bill + FAFSA = stack benefits (use both). FAFSA income: Include BAH, BAS, bonuses (but combat pay excluded). Filing deadline: October 1 annually for next academic year. Expected Family Contribution (EFC): Lower = more aid. Pell Grant: $0-$7,395/year free money (doesn't reduce GI Bill). Military dependents: File as dependent until age 24 OR independent if married/have kids. CSS Profile required for some private schools (asks more detailed questions). Apply even if using GI Bill - you may get additional grants/scholarships.

## FAFSA Basics for Military

### What Is FAFSA?

**Free Application for Federal Student Aid:**
- Application for college financial aid
- Required for: Pell Grants, student loans, work-study, most scholarships
- Free to file (never pay someone to fill out FAFSA)
- Determines Expected Family Contribution (EFC) - how much family can pay

**Types of aid FAFSA unlocks:**
- Pell Grant: $0-$7,395/year (free money, based on income)
- Subsidized loans: $3,500-$5,500/year (government pays interest while in school)
- Unsubsidized loans: $5,500-$12,500/year (you pay all interest)
- Work-study: Part-time job on campus
- State grants: Varies by state
- School scholarships: Many require FAFSA

### Why Military Members Should File FAFSA

**Even if using GI Bill:**
- Pell Grant doesn't reduce GI Bill (stack both!)
- State grants available
- School scholarships often require FAFSA
- Work-study option (earn extra money)

**You're independent = more aid:**
- Independent students get more aid than dependent
- Lower parent income doesn't count against you

## Military Dependency Status (Critical)

### Active Duty = Automatic Independent Student

**If you're active duty military:**
- ✅ File as independent (regardless of age)
- ✅ Don't report parent income
- ✅ Only report YOUR income (+ spouse if married)

**Why it matters:**
- Independent students eligible for more aid
- Parent income often too high (would disqualify from aid)

**Proof required:**
- Copy of military ID
- Statement of service (from personnel office)

### Veterans = Independent

**If you're a veteran:**
- ✅ Independent student status
- ✅ Don't report parent income

**Veteran definition (for FAFSA):**
- Served on active duty
- Released under conditions other than dishonorable

**Note:** Even 19-year-old veteran = independent (age doesn't matter)

### Military Dependents (Spouse, Kids)

**Dependent of active duty member:**
- File as **dependent** student (report parent/sponsor income) UNLESS:
  - Age 24+
  - Married
  - Have own kids
  - Veteran themselves

**Exception - Emancipated Minor:**
- Some military kids are legally emancipated (rare)
- File as independent if legally emancipated

## Income Reporting for Military

### What Military Income to Report

**Include on FAFSA:**
- ✅ Base pay
- ✅ BAH (housing allowance)
- ✅ BAS (food allowance)
- ✅ Bonuses (re-enlistment, special pay)
- ✅ Hazard pay
- ✅ Sea pay, flight pay

**Exclude from FAFSA:**
- ❌ Combat zone pay (tax-free combat pay NOT reported)
- ❌ VA disability compensation (non-taxable)

**Where to find income:**
- W-2 (Box 1 = taxable income)
- LES (Leave and Earnings Statement)
- Tax return (AGI - Adjusted Gross Income)

**Example (E-5 with dependents):**
- Base pay: $45,000
- BAH: $30,000
- BAS: $5,000
- Combat pay: $10,000 (6-month deployment)
- **Report on FAFSA: $80,000** (combat pay excluded)

### Assets to Report

**Report:**
- Savings/checking accounts (as of filing date)
- Investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds)
- Real estate (not primary home)
- Business value

**Don't report:**
- Primary home value
- Retirement accounts (TSP, IRA, 401k)
- Life insurance cash value
- Cars

**Impact:**
- Assets reduce aid (but less than income)
- Parents' assets (if dependent student): 5.64% counted toward EFC
- Student assets: 20% counted toward EFC

**Strategy:**
- Pay down debt before filing (reduces assets on paper)
- Don't keep large cash in student's name (if dependent)

## FAFSA + GI Bill (Stacking Benefits)

### Can You Use Both?

**YES - stack them:**
- GI Bill pays tuition, housing (MHA), books
- Pell Grant = extra free money (doesn't reduce GI Bill)
- Total: GI Bill + Pell Grant = $7,395/year more

**Example:**
- Tuition: $10,000 (GI Bill pays)
- MHA: $2,000/month (GI Bill)
- Pell Grant: $7,395/year (FAFSA)
- **Total benefit: $10,000 + $24,000 + $7,395 = $41,395**

### Pell Grant Eligibility

**Income limits (approximate):**
- EFC = 0 (maximum Pell): Income ~$30,000 or less
- Partial Pell: Income $30,000-$60,000
- No Pell: Income >$60,000 (varies by family size)

**Active duty E-5:**
- Income: $70,000 (base + BAH + BAS)
- Likely: No Pell (income too high)

**Veteran (using GI Bill, not working):**
- Income: $0 (GI Bill MHA not counted as income!)
- Likely: Maximum Pell ($7,395/year)

**Why this matters:**
- Veterans get Pell even while getting GI Bill (because MHA ≠ income for FAFSA)

## How to File FAFSA (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Create FSA ID (Do This First)

**What it is:**
- Username + password for FAFSA
- Digital signature (legally binding)

**Who needs one:**
- Student
- One parent (if dependent student)

**Create at:** StudentAid.gov/fsa-id

**Keep it safe:** You'll use same FSA ID all 4 years

### Step 2: Gather Documents

**Need:**
- Social Security Number
- Driver's license
- Tax return (prior-prior year - see below)
- W-2
- Bank statements (as of filing date)
- Investment statements
- Military ID (for independent status)

**Prior-Prior Year:**
- Filing for 2025-2026 school year?
- Use 2023 tax return (two years prior)
- Already filed = easy

### Step 3: File FAFSA Online

**Go to:** FAFSA.gov

**Fill out:**
- Personal info (name, SSN, DOB)
- School selection (add 10 schools - they all get your FAFSA)
- Dependency status (answer questions → determines independent vs. dependent)
- Income (from tax return)
- Assets (bank accounts, investments)

**Sign:** Use FSA ID (digital signature)

**Submit:** Takes 30-60 minutes

### Step 4: Review SAR (Student Aid Report)

**Within 3-5 days:**
- Receive SAR via email
- Review for errors
- Note your EFC (Expected Family Contribution)

**EFC examples:**
- EFC = 0: Maximum aid (Pell Grant, subsidized loans)
- EFC = 10,000: Some aid (partial Pell, loans)
- EFC = 30,000: Little aid (maybe unsubsidized loans only)

### Step 5: Wait for School Financial Aid Offers

**Timeline:**
- File FAFSA: October-January
- Schools send aid offers: March-April
- Accept/decline: By May 1 (typically)

**Compare offers:**
- School A: $10,000 grants + $5,000 loans
- School B: $15,000 grants + $3,000 loans
- School B = better (more grants, less debt)

## FAFSA Deadlines

### Federal Deadline

**Opens:** October 1 (for next academic year)

**Example:**
- October 1, 2024: File for 2025-2026 school year

**No federal deadline** (but earlier = better)

### State Deadlines (CRITICAL)

**Vary by state:**
- California: March 2
- Illinois: As soon as possible after October 1
- Texas: January 15

**Why it matters:**
- State grants = first-come, first-served
- Miss deadline = lose state grant money

**Check your state:** Google "[State] FAFSA deadline"

### School Deadlines

**Each school sets own deadline:**
- Often February-March
- Priority deadline (file by this date for most aid)

**Check each school's website**

## Common FAFSA Mistakes (Military)

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Filing Because "I Make Too Much"

**Reality:**
- "I make $80K, I won't get aid"
- Doesn't file FAFSA
- Misses: Scholarships requiring FAFSA, unsubsidized loans (if needed)

**Fix:** File anyway (takes 30-60 min, might qualify for something)

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Filing Because "I Have GI Bill"

**Reality:**
- Uses GI Bill, doesn't file FAFSA
- Misses: Pell Grant ($7,395/year free), state grants, scholarships

**Fix:** File FAFSA even with GI Bill (stack benefits!)

### ❌ Mistake #3: Reporting Combat Pay

**Reality:**
- Reports combat pay as income
- Income looks higher than it is
- Disqualified from aid unnecessarily

**Fix:** Exclude combat zone pay (it's tax-free, don't report on FAFSA)

### ❌ Mistake #4: Reporting VA Disability as Income

**Reality:**
- Gets VA disability ($2,000/month)
- Reports on FAFSA as income
- Reduces aid eligibility

**Fix:** VA disability = NOT income for FAFSA (don't report)

### ❌ Mistake #5: Filing as Dependent (When Active Duty)

**Reality:**
- Active duty E-3, age 20
- Files as dependent (reports parent income $150K)
- Gets $0 aid

**Fix:** Active duty = automatic independent (don't report parent income)

## CSS Profile (For Private Schools)

### What Is CSS Profile?

**College Scholarship Service Profile:**
- Additional financial aid application
- Required by ~200 private colleges
- MORE detailed than FAFSA
- Costs $25 + $16 per school

**Who uses it:**
- Private schools (Harvard, Stanford, etc.)
- Some state schools

**Differences from FAFSA:**
- Asks about home equity (FAFSA doesn't)
- Asks about retirement accounts (FAFSA doesn't)
- Asks about non-custodial parent income (divorced families)

### Should Military File CSS Profile?

**File if:**
- Applying to schools that require it (check school's website)

**Don't file if:**
- Only applying to public schools (usually don't require)

**Cost:** $25 + $16 per school = $57-$100+ total

**Remember:** File FAFSA even if using GI Bill (stack benefits = Pell Grant + GI Bill). Military = automatic independent student (more aid eligibility). Include BAH/BAS in income, exclude combat pay and VA disability. File early (October-December) for best aid. Takes 30-60 minutes. Free money available (Pell Grant $0-$7,395/year). Don't leave money on the table. File every year.
