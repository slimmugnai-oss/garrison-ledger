# Marriage & BAH: Financial Impact of Getting Married in the Military (2025)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Getting married increases BAH by $600-$1,500/month (depending on rank and location). Junior enlisted see the biggest percentage increase. But marriage also affects taxes, SGLI, TSP beneficiaries, and healthcare. Don't marry for BAH alone — but if you're already planning to marry, understanding the financial impact helps you plan better.

## BAH With-Dependents vs. Without-Dependents

### The BAH Increase When You Marry

| **Rank** | **Location** | **BAH Without Deps** | **BAH With Deps** | **Monthly Increase** | **Annual Increase** |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| E-3 | San Diego, CA | $2,409 | $3,243 | **+$834** | **+$10,008** |
| E-5 | San Antonio, TX | $1,497 | $1,893 | **+$396** | **+$4,752** |
| E-7 | Norfolk, VA | $1,788 | $2,202 | **+$414** | **+$4,968** |
| O-3 | DC Metro | $2,592 | $3,252 | **+$660** | **+$7,920** |

**Key Insight:** Junior enlisted (E-1 to E-4) get the BIGGEST percentage increase — often 30-50% more BAH.

### When BAH Changes

**Effective date:** BAH changes the **1st of the month AFTER** you update DEERS with marriage certificate

**Example:**
- Get married: June 15
- Update DEERS: June 20
- BAH increase: July 1
- You do NOT get prorated BAH for June

**Action:** Update DEERS immediately after marriage to avoid delaying BAH increase.

## The "Don't Marry for BAH" Reality Check

### Why You Shouldn't Marry Just for BAH

**Divorce is expensive:**
- Legal fees: $5,000-$20,000
- Alimony (possible if married 10+ years)
- Division of TSP/retirement (if married during service)
- Child support (if kids involved)

**Marriage is work:**
- Deployments strain relationships
- PCS moves disrupt spouse careers
- Military lifestyle is demanding

**BAH is taxable (indirectly):**
- While BAH itself is tax-free, it doesn't increase your taxable income
- But divorce settlements CAN claim a portion of your income (including BAH)

**Better reasons to marry:**
- You love each other
- You're committed for life
- You want to build a family together

**BAH should be a BONUS, not the reason.**

## Tax Filing After Marriage

### Married Filing Jointly vs. Married Filing Separately

**Most military couples should file Jointly:**

**Pros:**
- Lower tax rates
- Higher standard deduction ($29,200 in 2025)
- Qualify for more credits (Child Tax Credit, EITC)

**Cons:**
- Both liable for any tax debt
- Must combine incomes

**Married Filing Separately (rare):**

**When to use:**
- Spouse has major tax debt/liens
- Spouse has income-based student loan repayment
- Unusual income situations

**Cons:**
- Higher tax rates
- Lose many credits/deductions

**Default:** File Jointly unless you have specific reason not to.

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Updating DEERS Immediately
**Reality:** You delay BAH increase by 1-2 months.

**Fix:** Go to ID card office within 1 week of getting marriage certificate.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Thinking BAH Is "Extra Money"
**Reality:** BAH is for HOUSING. If you spend it all on rent, you have $0 left.

**Fix:** Find rent BELOW your BAH rate. Pocket the difference.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Updating SGLI Beneficiary
**Reality:** Your ex-girlfriend is still listed. She gets $400,000 if you die.

**Fix:** Update SGLI beneficiary to spouse via myPay or personnel office.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Assuming Dual-Military = Double BAH
**Reality:** If you have kids, only ONE of you gets "with dependents" rate.

**Fix:** Understand the dual-military BAH rules before assuming income.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Marrying in December
**Reality:** BAH doesn't increase until January 1st anyway (you lose 1-4 weeks of higher BAH).

**Fix:** If you're planning a winter wedding, consider early December or wait until January for tax/BAH timing.
