## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Waiting Too Long to Start Process
**Reality:** You start pet prep 1 month before PCS to Japan. Rabies blood test takes 6 months. Pet can't travel with you.

**Fix:** Start 6-9 months before OCONUS PCS. Research requirements immediately after getting orders.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Getting Right Microchip
**Reality:** Your pet has US microchip (non-ISO standard). Europe requires ISO chip. You have to re-chip pet.

**Fix:** Get ISO 11784/11785 microchip from start (works worldwide).

### ❌ Mistake #3: Flying Pet in Summer Heat
**Reality:** You fly pet in July. Airline refuses cargo (too hot). Pet can't travel.

**Fix:** Fly pets in spring/fall (cool weather). Avoid summer for cargo shipments.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Budgeting for Pet Costs
**Reality:** You budget $1,000 for pet PCS. Actual cost: $3,500. You go into debt.

**Fix:** Budget $2,000-$4,000 per pet for OCONUS. Start saving 6+ months ahead.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Crate Training Pet
**Reality:** Pet never been in crate. Freaks out during 14-hour flight. Arrives traumatized.

**Fix:** Crate train 2-3 months before travel. Make crate comfortable and familiar.
