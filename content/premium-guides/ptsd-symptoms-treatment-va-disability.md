# PTSD: Symptoms, Treatment Options, and VA Disability Rating Guide

**Bottom Line Up Front:** PTSD is a treatable condition affecting 10-30% of combat veterans. Symptoms include intrusive memories, avoidance, negative mood changes, and hypervigilance. Treatment (therapy + medication) is 70-80% effective. VA disability ratings range from 0% to 100%, with most combat veterans qualifying for 50-70%. Getting help does NOT end your military career or security clearance.

## What Is PTSD?

### 1. Intrusive Memories (Re-experiencing)
- Flashbacks (feeling like you're back in the traumatic event)
- Nightmares about the event
- Intrusive thoughts that won't go away
- Intense distress when reminded of the trauma

**Example:** Hearing a car backfire and immediately dropping to the ground, heart racing, feeling like you're back in a firefight.

### 2. Avoidance
- Avoiding places, people, or activities that remind you of the trauma

- Emotional numbness
- Detachment from loved ones

**Example:** Refusing to watch news about the war, avoiding veteran gatherings, not talking to family about deployment.

### 3. Negative Changes in Mood and Thinking
- Persistent negative beliefs ("The world is dangerous," "I can't trust anyone")
- Distorted blame of self or others
- Persistent negative emotions (fear, anger, guilt, shame)
- Loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy
- Feeling detached from others
- Inability to feel positive emotions

**Example:** Believing "I should have saved my buddy" and feeling overwhelming guilt, even when you did everything you could.

### 4. Hyperarousal (Increased Reactivity)
- Irritability, angry outbursts
- Hypervigilance (constantly scanning for threats)
- Exaggerated startle response
- Difficulty concentrating
- Sleep problems
- Reckless or self-destructive behavior

**Example:** Always sitting with your back to the wall at restaurants, scanning exits, unable to relax even at home.

## PTSD Treatment Options (What Actually Works)

### 2. Prolonged Exposure (PE) Therapy

- Therapist helps you confront avoided situations
- Over time, memories lose their power

**Effectiveness:** 60-80% of patients improve significantly

### 3. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)
**What it is:**

- 6-12 sessions

**Effectiveness:** 60-70% improvement rate

**Why it works:**
- Engages both sides of the brain
- Reduces emotional intensity of memories

### 4. Medications

**SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) - First-line:**
- **Sertraline (Zoloft)** - Most commonly prescribed
- **Paroxetine (Paxil)** - Also effective
- **Fluoxetine (Prozac)** - Alternative option

**How they help:**
- Reduce intrusive thoughts
- Improve mood
- Reduce hyperarousal
- **Takes 4-6 weeks to work**

**SNRIs:**
- **Venlafaxine (Effexor)** - For those who don't respond to SSRIs

**Prazosin:**
- Specifically for nightmares
- Taken before bed
- 70-80% effective for reducing combat-related nightmares

## Common PTSD Myths (BUSTED)

### ❌ Myth #1: "Only combat veterans get PTSD"
**Reality:** MST (Military Sexual Trauma), vehicle accidents, witnessing death, and non-combat trauma can all cause PTSD.

### ❌ Myth #2: "Seeking help will end my career"
**Reality:** Thousands of service members get PTSD treatment and continue serving. Only severe, untreated PTSD leads to discharge.

### ❌ Myth #3: "PTSD means I'm weak"
**Reality:** PTSD is a biological response to extreme stress. Your brain is doing what it's supposed to do after trauma. Seeking help is strength.

### ❌ Myth #4: "Therapy won't help"
**Reality:** 70-80% of people who complete PTSD treatment see significant improvement. It works.

### ❌ Myth #5: "I'll lose my security clearance"
**Reality:** Seeking mental health treatment does NOT automatically disqualify you. UNTREATED mental health issues are what hurt clearances.
