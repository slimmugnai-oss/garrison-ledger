# TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) in Military: Symptoms, Treatment & VA Disability

**Bottom Line Up Front:** 20-30% of OEF/OIF veterans have TBI (blast exposure, vehicle accidents, impacts). Symptoms: Headaches, memory problems, irritability, light/noise sensitivity, sleep issues. Often misdiagnosed as PTSD (many have both). Treatment: Cognitive therapy, medication for symptoms, vestibular therapy (balance), vision therapy. VA disability: 0-100% rating ($0-$3,900/month). Document ALL head injuries (even "minor") - symptoms appear months/years later. MRI usually normal (TBI is functional injury, not structural).

## What is TBI?

### Definition

**Traumatic Brain Injury:** Brain function disruption from external force (blast, impact, acceleration/deceleration)

**Military-specific causes:**
- IED blasts (most common in Iraq/Afghanistan)
- Vehicle rollovers (Humvee, MRAP)
- Mortars/rockets (pressure wave)
- Falls (helicopter, building, training accidents)
- Fights/assaults
- Repeated subconcussive impacts (breaching, heavy weapons, parachute landings)

### TBI Severity Levels

**Mild TBI (mTBI) / Concussion:**
- Loss of consciousness: <30 minutes (or none)
- Memory loss: <24 hours
- **80-90% of military TBI = mild**
- Symptoms: Headaches, dizziness, confusion, sensitivity

**Moderate TBI:**
- Loss of consciousness: 30 minutes - 24 hours
- Memory loss: >24 hours
- Symptoms: Cognitive issues, mood changes, physical symptoms

**Severe TBI:**
- Loss of consciousness: >24 hours
- Permanent disability common
- Symptoms: Major cognitive/physical impairment

**Reality:** Even "mild" TBI causes long-term problems if untreated

## TBI Symptoms (What to Watch For)

### Physical Symptoms

**Headaches:**
- Constant or frequent
- Worse with physical activity, stress, bright lights
- Different from pre-injury headaches

**Dizziness/Balance problems:**
- Room spinning
- Unsteady on feet
- Worse in crowds, busy environments

**Light/Noise sensitivity:**
- Sunglasses needed indoors
- Can't tolerate loud environments (restaurants, malls)
- Fluorescent lights trigger headaches

**Vision problems:**
- Blurry vision
- Double vision
- Difficulty tracking moving objects (reading = eyes jump)

**Tinnitus (ringing in ears):**
- Constant or intermittent
- Often accompanies TBI from blast

### Cognitive Symptoms

**Memory problems:**
- Forget appointments, conversations
- Can't remember where you parked car
- Lose track of daily tasks

**Concentration issues:**
- Can't focus on work/reading for >10 minutes
- Easily distracted
- "Brain fog" (thoughts feel slow/thick)

**Processing speed:**
- Takes longer to understand instructions
- Need things repeated
- Struggle with multitasking

**Executive function:**
- Planning/organizing difficult
- Can't prioritize tasks
- Difficulty making decisions

### Emotional/Behavioral Symptoms

**Irritability:**
- Quick to anger (rage over small things)
- Low frustration tolerance
- Yelling at spouse/kids

**Depression:**
- Loss of interest in hobbies
- Fatigue
- Hopelessness

**Anxiety:**
- Constant worry
- Panic attacks
- Avoidance of crowds/noise

**Personality changes:**
- "Not the same person anymore"
- Impulsive (spending, risky behavior)
- Social withdrawal

### Sleep Symptoms

**Insomnia:**
- Can't fall asleep
- Wake frequently
- Never feel rested

**Hypersomnia:**
- Sleep 10-14 hours, still tired
- Naps daily

## TBI vs. PTSD (Often Both)

### Symptom Overlap

**Both TBI and PTSD cause:**
- Irritability
- Sleep problems
- Concentration issues
- Memory problems
- Social withdrawal

### How to Tell the Difference

**TBI-specific:**
- ✅ Headaches (physical)
- ✅ Dizziness, balance problems
- ✅ Light/noise sensitivity
- ✅ Vision problems
- ✅ Symptoms started AFTER head injury event

**PTSD-specific:**
- ✅ Nightmares (combat, trauma)
- ✅ Flashbacks
- ✅ Hypervigilance (scanning for threats)
- ✅ Avoidance (places, people, reminders)
- ✅ Symptoms started AFTER traumatic event (may not involve head injury)

**Many veterans have BOTH:**
- IED blast = TBI (head injury) + PTSD (trauma)
- Treatment for both often needed

---

## Diagnosis & Testing

### Clinical Evaluation

**What to expect at TBI clinic:**
- Medical history (head injuries, symptoms timeline)
- Neurological exam (reflexes, coordination, balance)
- Cognitive testing (memory, attention, processing speed)

### Imaging (Usually Normal!)

**MRI/CT scan:**
- Often normal in mild TBI
- **Normal scan does NOT mean "no TBI"**
- TBI is functional injury (brain cells damaged but structure intact)

**Advanced imaging (research settings):**
- DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging) - shows white matter damage
- Not widely available for clinical use yet

### Cognitive Testing

**Common tests:**
- ANAM (Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics)
- MACE (Military Acute Concussion Evaluation)
- Full neuropsych battery (4-6 hours of testing)

**What they measure:**
- Memory (short-term, long-term)
- Attention/concentration
- Processing speed
- Executive function (planning, problem-solving)

### Self-Report Questionnaires

**NSI (Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory):**
- 22-item checklist
- Rate symptoms 0-4 (none to very severe)
- Track symptoms over time

## Treatment Options

### Cognitive Rehabilitation

**What it is:**
- Therapy to retrain brain (compensate for deficits)
- Memory strategies (calendars, reminders, routines)
- Attention training
- Problem-solving practice

**Effectiveness:** 60-70% improvement in daily function

**Where to get:**
- VA TBI clinic
- TRICARE-covered civilian therapist

### Medication (Symptom Management)

**For headaches:**
- Preventive: Topiramate, propranolol
- Acute: Triptans (for migraines)
- **Avoid:** Opioids (addictive, don't fix TBI)

**For cognitive issues:**
- Stimulants: Modafinil, methylphenidate (improve focus)
- Memantine (memory support)

**For sleep:**
- Melatonin (3-10 mg)
- Prazosin (if nightmares)
- Trazodone (low dose)

**For mood:**
- SSRIs (sertraline, escitalopram) for depression/anxiety

### Vestibular Therapy (Balance/Dizziness)

**What it is:**
- Physical therapy for inner ear/balance system
- Exercises to retrain balance

**Effectiveness:** 70-80% reduction in dizziness

**Duration:** 6-12 weeks

### Vision Therapy

**For TBI vision problems:**
- Eye tracking exercises
- Convergence training (eyes working together)
- Prism glasses (correct double vision)

**Effectiveness:** 60-80% improvement

### Complementary Therapies

**May help (some evidence):**
- Acupuncture (headaches)
- Massage (muscle tension, headaches)
- Yoga (stress, balance)
- Meditation (cognitive function, stress)

**Worth trying:** Low risk, may provide relief

## VA Disability Rating for TBI

### How TBI Is Rated

**Based on 10 symptom areas:**
1. Memory, attention, concentration
2. Executive function
3. Judgment, reasoning
4. Social interaction
5. Orientation
6. Communication
7. Mood
8. Motor activity
9. Visual/spatial function
10. Subjective symptoms (headaches, dizziness)

**Rating levels:**
- **0%:** Mild TBI with no current symptoms (still service-connected!)
- **10%:** Minimal symptoms, no functional impact
- **40%:** Moderate symptoms, some functional impact
- **70%:** Severe symptoms, major functional impact
- **100%:** Total occupational/social impairment

### TBI VA Disability Compensation (2025)

- **0%:** $0/month (but service-connected for future increases)
- **10%:** $171/month
- **40%:** $755/month (with spouse/kids: $850-$950)
- **70%:** $1,716/month (with spouse/kids: $1,850-$2,050)
- **100%:** $3,900/month (with spouse/kids: $4,100-$4,500)

### Secondary Conditions to TBI

**Can also claim:**
- Migraines secondary to TBI (0-50%)
- Insomnia secondary to TBI (included in TBI rating or separate)
- PTSD (separate condition, can have both)
- Tinnitus (10% flat rate, very common with blast TBI)
- Depression/anxiety secondary to TBI

**Many veterans get 70-100% combined** (TBI + secondaries)

## Documenting TBI for VA Claims

### Critical Documentation

**1. Evidence of head injury event:**
- Incident report (IED blast, vehicle rollover)
- Medical records (concussion diagnosis, even if "cleared" same day)
- Buddy statements ("I was there when he got blown up")

**2. Current diagnosis:**
- TBI clinic evaluation
- Neuropsychological testing results
- Neurologist diagnosis

**3. Nexus (connection):**
- Doctor's statement: "Veteran's TBI symptoms are at least as likely as not related to [IED blast in 2010]"

**4. Symptom timeline:**
- When symptoms started (right after injury OR months later = both valid)
- How symptoms affect daily life (can't work, can't drive, relationship problems)

### Common TBI Claim Mistakes

**❌ Mistake #1: "Minor concussion, I was fine"**
- Reality: You were "cleared" after 10 minutes, told to return to duty
- Years later: Headaches, memory problems, anger issues
- VA: "No documentation of TBI"

**Fix:** Document EVERY head injury (even if minor). Symptoms appear later.

**❌ Mistake #2: Not getting TBI screening**
- Reality: Never got TBI eval during service (symptoms dismissed as stress)
- VA: "No medical evidence of TBI"

**Fix:** Get TBI screening ASAP (VA offers free TBI evaluations for all OEF/OIF vets)

**❌ Mistake #3: Attributing all symptoms to PTSD**
- Reality: File PTSD claim, mention memory/sleep issues
- VA: Rates PTSD at 50%, misses TBI
- Could have 70% PTSD + 70% TBI = 90% combined

**Fix:** File separate TBI claim (can have both)
