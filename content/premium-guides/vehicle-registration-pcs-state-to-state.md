# Vehicle Registration During PCS: State-to-State Transfer Guide

**Bottom Line Up Front:** You have 30-90 days to register vehicle in new state after PCS (varies by state). SCRA allows you to maintain registration in home state (avoid annual re-registration). Some states exempt military from sales tax on vehicles. Get temp tags if needed. Register on-base if available (easier). Bring: PCS orders, insurance, title, old registration, military ID.

## SCRA Vehicle Registration Exemption

### The Rule
**Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)** allows you to:
- Keep vehicle registered in home state
- Even if stationed in different state
- Avoid re-registering every PCS

**Requirements:**
- Vehicle must be registered in your Home of Record OR state where you're legal resident
- You must have PCS orders to current duty station

**Example:**
- Home of Record: Texas
- Stationed in: Virginia

- Don't have to register in Virginia

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Driving with Expired Registration
**Reality:** You PCS to new state. Keep home state plates. But registration expires. Cop pulls you over. Ticket.

**Fix:** Keep registration current (renew online from overseas if needed).

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Updating Insurance
**Reality:** You PCS to Virginia. Don't update insurance. Get in accident. Insurance denies claim (wrong garaging address).

**Fix:** Update insurance within 30 days of PCS.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Paying Sales Tax When Exempt
**Reality:** Dealership charges you $2,000 sales tax. You're exempt under SCRA.

**Fix:** Know your state's military sales tax exemption. Refuse to pay.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Shipping Gas-Guzzler to Europe
**Reality:** Ship F-150 to Germany. Gas is $8/gallon. Costs $400/month.

**Fix:** Ship fuel-efficient car or buy local.
