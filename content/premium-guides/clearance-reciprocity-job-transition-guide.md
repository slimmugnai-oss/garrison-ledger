# Security Clearance Reciprocity: Using Your Clearance for Civilian Jobs

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Active clearance = $10K-$30K salary premium in civilian sector. Clearance reciprocity: Federal agencies + contractors accept existing clearance (don't re-investigate if clearance current). Secret clearance valid 10 years, Top Secret valid 5 years. Job requirement: Must be hired within 2 years of leaving active duty (clearance stays active). High-demand: Cybersecurity cleared professionals ($90K-$160K), intelligence analysts ($80K-$140K), program managers ($100K-$150K). Best employers: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Booz Allen, SAIC, Leidos. Maintain clearance: Don't let it lapse (apply for cleared jobs BEFORE separation if possible).

## Understanding Security Clearance Value

### Clearance Types & Renewal Timelines

**Confidential:**
- Renewal: Every 15 years
- Least valuable (few jobs require)
- Salary premium: $5K-$10K

**Secret:**

- Jobs: Logistics, admin, general contractor work

**Top Secret:**

- Jobs: Intelligence analysis, special access programs, senior roles

**Polygraph (CI or Lifestyle):**
- Some TS/SCI require polygraph
- Adds value (fewer people qualify)
- Premium: +$10K-$20K beyond TS/SCI

### Civilian Salary Premium

**Same job, cleared vs. non-cleared:**
- IT Specialist (no clearance): $70K
- IT Specialist (Secret): $80K-$85K
- IT Specialist (TS/SCI): $95K-$110K

**Why:**

- Access (cleared employees can work on more projects)

## Clearance Reciprocity (How It Works)

### What Is Reciprocity?

**Definition:** Government agency or contractor accepts your existing clearance (doesn't re-investigate)

**Example:**
- You: Active duty Army, Top Secret clearance
- You separate, hired by Lockheed Martin
- Lockheed: Accepts your TS clearance (no new investigation)
- You start cleared work immediately

**Saves:**
- Time: 6-24 months (investigation duration)
- Cost: $5K-$15K (company doesn't pay for new investigation)

### Requirements for Reciprocity

**Your clearance must be:**
- ✅ Current (not expired)
- ✅ In-scope (investigated within past 5 years for TS, 10 years for Secret)
- ✅ Same level or lower (TS transfers to Secret job, Secret doesn't transfer to TS job)

**You must:**
- ✅ Be hired by cleared employer (government or contractor)
- ✅ Need clearance for job (can't just keep it for fun)

**Timeline:**
- Hired within 2 years of leaving active duty = clearance stays active
- After 2 years inactive = clearance lapses (need reinvestigation)

### Verification Process

**New employer:**
1. Requests clearance verification (from your previous security office)
2. Receives confirmation (clearance level, scope date)
3. Sponsors your clearance transfer (submit SF-86C - Certification)
4. Access granted (usually within 30-60 days)

**You provide:**
- Last SF-86 (security clearance application - get copy before separating!)
- Contact info for previous security manager
- Dates of investigation

## Maintaining Clearance During Transition

### Before Separation (Critical)

**60-90 days before:**
1. ✅ Get copy of last SF-86 (security clearance application)
2. ✅ Get copy of investigation records (if possible)
3. ✅ Note: Security manager contact info (for verification)

**30 days before:**
1. ✅ Apply for cleared jobs (BEFORE separating keeps clearance active)
2. ✅ Network with cleared employers
3. ✅ Out-brief with security manager (ask about clearance transfer process)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Separate without applying to cleared jobs (clearance stays active 24 months, but start job search early)

### After Separation (2-Year Window)

**Your clearance:**
- Active for 24 months after leaving active duty (if in-scope)
- After 24 months = lapses (needs reinvestigation)

**To maintain:**
- Get hired by cleared employer within 24 months
- Start cleared work (clearance transfers)

**If you don't:**
- Clearance lapses
- Future employer must reinvestigate you (costs them $5K-$15K, takes 12-24 months)
