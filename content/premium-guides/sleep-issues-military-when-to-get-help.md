# Sleep Issues in the Military: When to Get Help & Treatment Options

**Bottom Line Up Front:** 60-80% of service members have sleep problems (insomnia, nightmares, sleep apnea). Chronic sleep deprivation impairs performance worse than alcohol intoxication. TRICARE covers sleep studies and treatment. Most cases improve with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) + sleep hygiene. Don't ignore sleep issues — they're linked to PTSD, depression, and safety incidents.

## Sleep Problems in the Military (The Reality)

### The Numbers

## Treatment Options (What Actually Works)

### 1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)

**What it is:**
- 4-8 session structured therapy
- Teaches sleep habits and thought patterns
- NO medication

**Techniques:**
- Sleep restriction (limiting time in bed)
- Stimulus control (bed = sleep only)
- Cognitive restructuring (changing anxious thoughts about sleep)
- Relaxation training

**Effectiveness:** 70-80% of patients improve

**Where to get it:**
- Military behavioral health clinics
- Vet Centers
- TRICARE-covered civilian providers

### 2. Medications (Short-Term Only)

**Prescription Sleep Aids:**

**Trazodone** (most common for military)
- Antidepressant used off-label for sleep
- Low addiction risk
- Dose: 25-100mg before bed

**Zolpidem (Ambien)**
- Effective for falling asleep
- Risk: Sleepwalking, amnesia
- Avoid long-term use

**Prazosin** (for PTSD nightmares)
- Reduces combat-related nightmares
- 70-80% effective
- Dose: 1-20mg before bed

**Over-the-Counter:**
- Melatonin (3-5mg)
- Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) — causes next-day drowsiness
- Magnesium

**Warning:** Sleep meds are SHORT-TERM solutions. CBT-I is long-term cure.

### 3. Sleep Apnea Treatment (CPAP)

**If diagnosed with sleep apnea:**
- CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machine
- Wears mask during sleep
- Keeps airway open
- 90% effective

**Alternative treatments:**
- Oral appliances (mouthguards)
- Weight loss (if overweight)
- Surgery (severe cases)

**CPAP compliance:**
- Takes 1-2 weeks to adjust
- Life-changing for most users
- Reduces heart disease risk by 40%

### 4. Sleep Hygiene (Foundation)

**Bedroom Environment:**
- ✅ Dark (blackout curtains)
- ✅ Cool (65-68°F)
- ✅ Quiet (white noise machine or earplugs)
- ✅ Comfortable mattress/pillows

**Sleep Schedule:**
- ✅ Same bedtime every night (even weekends)
- ✅ Same wake time
- ✅ 7-9 hours of sleep opportunity

**Pre-Sleep Routine:**
- ✅ No screens 1 hour before bed (blue light disrupts melatonin)
- ✅ No caffeine after 2 PM
- ✅ No alcohol (disrupts REM sleep)
- ✅ No heavy meals 3 hours before bed

**Daytime Habits:**
- ✅ Exercise (but not within 3 hours of bed)
- ✅ Sunlight exposure (helps circadian rhythm)
- ✅ Limit naps to 20-30 minutes before 3 PM

## Common Sleep Myths (BUSTED)

### ❌ Myth #1: "I Can Function Fine on 5 Hours of Sleep"
**Reality:** After 17 hours awake, impairment = 0.05% BAC (legally drunk in some states). Chronic sleep deprivation impairs cognitive function, reaction time, and decision-making.

### ❌ Myth #2: "Alcohol Helps Me Sleep"
**Reality:** Alcohol helps you FALL asleep but disrupts REM sleep. You wake up unrefreshed. Worsens insomnia long-term.

### ❌ Myth #3: "Sleep Aids Are the Only Solution"
**Reality:** CBT-I is more effective long-term than medication. Sleep meds are short-term fixes, not cures.

### ❌ Myth #4: "I'll Catch Up on Sleep This Weekend"
**Reality:** You can't "catch up" on chronic sleep debt. Irregular sleep schedules worsen insomnia.

### ❌ Myth #5: "Snoring Is Normal"
**Reality:** Loud snoring + gasping = sleep apnea. Can cause heart disease, stroke, sudden death. Get tested.

**Remember:** Sleep is NOT optional. It's as critical as fitness, nutrition, and training. Chronic sleep deprivation kills more service members in vehicle accidents than most combat injuries. Get help. Your life depends on it.
