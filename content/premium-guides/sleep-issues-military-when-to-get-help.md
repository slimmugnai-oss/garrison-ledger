# Sleep Issues in Military: When to Get Help & Treatment Options

**Bottom Line Up Front:** 40-60% of service members have chronic sleep problems (vs. 10-30% civilians). Common causes: shift work, deployment stress, PTSD, TBI, sleep apnea. Red flags: <6 hours sleep nightly, daytime exhaustion, microsleeps while driving, relying on energy drinks to function. Free treatment available: TRICARE covers sleep studies, CPAP machines, CBT-I (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia). Sleep medication is temporary fix - address root cause. Untreated sleep issues lead to depression, weight gain, accidents, career problems.

## Why Military Sleep Problems Are Different

### Unique Military Sleep Disruptors

**1. Shift Work & Irregular Schedules**
- Watchstanding (4 hours on, 8 hours off - Navy)
- 24-hour ops (rotating shifts - Security Forces, medical)
- Deployment schedules (work 12+ hours, sleep when you can)
- Result: Circadian rhythm destroyed

**2. Deployment-Related**
- Hypervigilance ("Can't turn off, always alert")
- Nightmares (combat, IED blasts, firefights)
- Sleeping with weapons ("Can't sleep without rifle nearby")
- Environmental noise (generators, mortars, alarms)

**3. Post-Deployment**
- Adjustment back to normal (brain still in combat mode)
- Nightmares persist for months/years
- Startling awake at every sound
- Insomnia from anxiety

**4. Physical Conditions**
- Sleep apnea (50% higher in military vs. civilians)
- TBI (traumatic brain injury) → sleep disruption
- Chronic pain → can't get comfortable

**5. Cultural Factors**
- "Sleep is weakness" mentality
- Work through exhaustion (mission first)
- Energy drinks normalized (Monster, Rip-Its = standard breakfast)

## Sleep Hygiene (Foundation for Better Sleep)

### Do's

**1. Consistent schedule:**
- Same bedtime/wake time (even weekends)
- Trains body's circadian rhythm

**2. Dark, cool, quiet bedroom:**
- Blackout curtains
- 65-68°F temperature
- White noise machine (blocks barracks noise)

**3. Wind-down routine (30-60 min before bed):**
- Read (not on phone)
- Shower
- Stretching
- Avoid screens (blue light disrupts melatonin)

**4. Exercise (but not before bed):**
- 30+ minutes daily
- Not within 3 hours of sleep

**5. Limit caffeine:**
- No caffeine after 2 PM
- Cut energy drinks (500mg+ caffeine = terrible for sleep)

### Don'ts

**1. No screens in bed:**
- Blue light = destroys sleep drive
- Use "Night Shift" mode if you must use phone

**2. Don't lie awake in bed:**
- If not asleep in 20 minutes, get up
- Do quiet activity until sleepy
- Return to bed

**3. Don't nap >30 minutes:**
- Short naps (20-30 min) = okay
- Long naps (1-2 hours) = destroys nighttime sleep

**4. Don't drink alcohol to sleep:**
- Falls asleep faster but RUINS sleep quality
- Wake at 3 AM when alcohol wears off

**5. Don't watch clock:**
- "It's 2 AM, I only have 4 hours left!" = anxiety
- Turn clock away from bed

## Energy Drink Trap (Why You're Exhausted)

### The Vicious Cycle

**1. Poor sleep → Exhausted**  
**2. Drink 2-3 Monsters (500mg+ caffeine)**  
**3. Caffeine lasts 6+ hours in body**  
**4. Can't sleep that night**  
**5. Repeat**

### Breaking the Cycle

**Week 1: Cut caffeine after 12 PM**
- Hard, you'll be tired
- Sleep improves slightly

**Week 2: Cut to 1 energy drink (morning only)**
- Replace afternoon caffeine with water, walk

**Week 3: Switch to coffee (less caffeine)**
- 1 cup coffee = 100mg caffeine
- 1 Monster = 300mg caffeine

**Week 4: Normal sleep returning**
- Fall asleep faster
- Sleep deeper
- Wake refreshed (no more energy drinks needed!)
