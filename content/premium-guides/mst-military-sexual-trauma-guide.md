# Military Sexual Trauma (MST): Reporting, Treatment & VA Benefits

**Bottom Line Up Front:** MST (Military Sexual Trauma) = sexual assault or harassment during military service. Affects 1 in 4 women, 1 in 100 men who serve. Reporting options: Restricted (confidential, get treatment, NO investigation) or Unrestricted (official investigation, potential prosecution). Free treatment: VA MST Coordinator at every VA, specialized therapy (CPT, PE), no VA claim required for MST treatment. VA disability: Can file claim for PTSD secondary to MST (30-100% rating = $524-$3,900/month). Reporting doesn't require "proof" - your testimony is evidence. You are not alone. Not your fault.

## What Is MST?

### Definition

**Military Sexual Trauma (VA definition):**
- Sexual assault OR
- Sexual harassment
- That occurred during military service

**Includes:**
- Rape, attempted rape
- Unwanted sexual touching
- Threatening, offensive remarks about body/sexual activities
- Sexual advances in exchange for favorable treatment (quid pro quo)

**Does NOT require:**
- Combat zone (can happen stateside, on base, during training)
- Deployment
- Filed official report (many survivors never report)
- Conviction of perpetrator (assault happened even if never prosecuted)

### Prevalence

**Statistics:**
- 1 in 4 women in military experience MST
- 1 in 100 men experience MST (often underreported)
- 20,000+ assaults per year (DOD report)

**Why reporting is low:**
- Fear of retaliation (career consequences)
- Shame, self-blame
- Don't trust chain of command
- Military culture ("suck it up," "deal with it")

**Reality:** You did nothing wrong. Assault is never the victim's fault.

## Reporting Options (Critical to Understand)

### Restricted Report (Confidential)

**What it is:**

- NO: Official investigation, command notification (with exceptions)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Confidential (chain of command NOT told)
- ✅ Get medical care + counseling
- ✅ Protection from retaliation
- ✅ Can convert to Unrestricted later (if you want investigation)

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ No investigation (perpetrator not held accountable)
- ❌ Can't pursue military justice

**Who it's for:**
- Want treatment but not ready for investigation
- Fear retaliation
- Need time to decide

**How to do it:**
1. Call SARC (on every base, 24/7 hotline)
2. Say: "I want to make a Restricted Report"
3. Get medical care, forensic exam (if within 72 hours)
4. Access counseling

### Unrestricted Report (Official Investigation)

**What it is:**

- Criminal investigation (NCIS, CID, OSI)
- Potential court-martial of perpetrator

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Official investigation

- ✅ Protection orders available

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ NOT confidential (command notified, investigation public-ish)

- ❌ May have to testify (court-martial)
- ❌ Retaliation risk (despite protections, it happens)

**Who it's for:**
- Want perpetrator prosecuted
- Ready for investigation process
- Willing to testify

**How to do it:**
1. Tell: Commander, SARC, law enforcement, OSI/CID/NCIS
2. Investigation begins (within 24 hours)
3. Forensic exam (SAPR Victim Advocate assists)
4. Interviews, evidence collection
5. Possible court-martial

### Can You Change from Restricted to Unrestricted?

**YES:**
- Restricted → Unrestricted (anytime)

**Do (if possible):**
1. ✅ Get to safe location
2. ✅ Call SARC: DoD Safe Helpline 877-995-5247 (24/7, confidential)

## Common MST Myths (Debunked)

### ❌ Myth #1: "You need proof to report"

**Reality:** Your testimony IS evidence. Don't need police report, witnesses, conviction.

### ❌ Myth #2: "If you report, your career is over"

**Reality:** Retaliation is illegal (doesn't mean it doesn't happen, but you have protections).

### ❌ Myth #3: "You should have fought back"

**Reality:** Freeze response is normal trauma reaction. Not fighting ≠ consent.

### ❌ Myth #4: "It's your fault for drinking/being alone/wearing that"

**Reality:** Assault is 100% the perpetrator's fault. Nothing you did caused it.

### ❌ Myth #5: "Men can't be victims of MST"

**Reality:** 1 in 100 men experience MST. It happens, it's valid, treatment is available.
