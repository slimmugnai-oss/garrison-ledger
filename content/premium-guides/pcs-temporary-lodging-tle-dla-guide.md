# Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) & Dislocation Allowance (DLA): PCS Moving Allowances

**Bottom Line Up Front:** TLE = Temporary lodging reimbursement during PCS ($290/day max, up to 10 days). DLA = One-time payment for PCS expenses ($2,000-$4,000 depending on rank/dependents). TLE eligibility: OCONUS to CONUS, CONUS to OCONUS, or special circumstances. File claim within 5 days of check-in. DLA: Automatic payment if authorized in orders, or file claim within 1 year. Both are separate from HHG shipment and DITY/PPM reimbursement. Save receipts for TLE (hotel, food). DLA doesn't require receipts (flat-rate payment).

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Saving Receipts

**Reality:**
- Spend $1,500 on hotels, food during TLE
- Don't save receipts
- Can't claim reimbursement → Lose $1,500

**Fix:** Save EVERY receipt (photo backup on phone)

### ❌ Mistake #2: Exceeding 10-Day TLE Limit

**Reality:**
- Stay in hotel 15 days waiting for house
- File TLE claim for 15 days
- Only reimbursed for 10 days → Out-of-pocket $1,450 (5 days × $290)

**Fix:** Move into permanent housing by day 10 (or pay out-of-pocket for extra days)

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Filing TLE Claim Within 5 Days

**Reality:**
- Use TLE, check in to new base
- Forget to file claim
- Remember 30 days later → Claim denied (missed 5-day deadline)

**Fix:** File immediately after check-in (don't wait)

### ❌ Mistake #4: Thinking DLA Covers Everything

**Reality:**
- Get $3,000 DLA
- Spend $5,000 on PCS expenses (deposits, utilities, furniture)
- Surprised DLA doesn't cover it all

**Fix:** DLA is partial reimbursement (budget for additional out-of-pocket costs)

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Checking if DLA Was Paid

**Reality:**
- DLA supposed to be automatic
- Never checks myPay
- 1 year passes → Too late to claim

**Fix:** Verify DLA payment within 60 days (check myPay, or call Finance if not received)

## Advanced: TLE Extension Requests

### Can You Get More Than 10 Days?

**Sometimes YES:**

**Scenarios where extension approved:**
- Base housing not available (waitlist)
- HHG shipment delayed (moving company issue)
- Natural disaster (hurricane, fire at new base)
- Special circumstances (medical, hardship)

**How to request:**
- Submit request to commander BEFORE day 10
- Provide justification (housing waitlist, HHG delay)
- Commander approves → Extension granted (usually 5-10 more days)

**Approval rate:** 50-70% (depends on circumstances)

**Denied?**
- Pay out-of-pocket OR
- Move into furnished apartment (short-term lease)

## Special Circumstances

### OCONUS TLE (Longer Duration)

**OCONUS PCS:**
- TLE duration: Up to 60 days (vs. 10 days CONUS)
- Rate: Locality-based ($200-$500/day)
- Why longer: Housing takes longer to arrange overseas

**Example: Germany PCS**
- TLE: Up to 30 days authorized
- Rate: $350/day
- Max reimbursement: 30 × $350 = $10,500

### First Duty Station (After Training)

**DLA for first PCS:**
- ✅ Authorized (even though it's first assignment)
- Amount: Lower rate (E-2 without dependents = ~$2,100)

**TLE:**
- Usually NOT authorized (moving to barracks, not waiting for house)
- Exception: Married, need time to find off-base housing

### Retirement/Separation PCS

**DLA:**
- ✅ Authorized (one final PCS from last duty station to home of record or anywhere in CONUS)

**TLE:**
