# USERRA: Employment Rights for Guard, Reserve & Veteran Employees

**Bottom Line Up Front:** USERRA (Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act) protects military members' civilian jobs. Key rights: Employer must hold job during deployment/training (up to 5 years cumulative), reemploy you at same position (or better if you would have been promoted), can't discriminate against Guard/Reserve, can't fire you for military service. Applies to: Deployments, annual training, drill weekends, military medical appointments. Notification: Tell employer ASAP (advance notice required unless emergency). Reemployment deadline: Report back within days to months depending on duty length (<31 days = next workday, >180 days = 90 days). Violations: Sue employer (free legal help via ESGR), back pay + benefits owed. Most employers comply (81% support Guard/Reserve).

## What Is USERRA?

## Key USERRA Rights

### 1. Reemployment Right (Must Take You Back)

**Rule:**
- Employer must reemploy you after military service (if you meet conditions)
- Same position OR position you would have attained (if you would have been promoted)
- Same seniority, pay, benefits

**Conditions:**
- Cumulative military service <5 years (with current employer)
- You gave advance notice (unless impossible)
- You return within deadline (see below)
- Discharge = honorable (not dishonorable)

**Example:**
- You: Sales rep, 2 years with company
- Deploy: 12 months
- Return: Must be reemployed as sales rep (or promoted if others were promoted during your absence)

**Escalation clause:**
- If your position eliminated (company downsized)
- Employer must offer similar position (same pay/level)

### 2. Advance Notice Requirement

**Must notify employer:**
- As soon as you receive orders (don't wait until last minute)
- Verbal or written (written = better, documented)

**Exception:**
- Military necessity prevents notice (emergency deployment, classified)
- Impossibility (no way to give notice)

**How to notify:**
"[Manager Name], I've received military orders for [deployment/training] from [start date] to [estimated end date]. I'm required to report [date]. I'll provide written orders as soon as available. Thank you."

**Employer can ask for:**
- Copy of orders (you must provide)
- Estimated return date (give best estimate)

### 3. Reemployment Deadline (When You Must Report Back)

**Service length determines deadline:**

**Less than 31 days (drill weekend, short training):**
- Report: Next workday after safe travel + 8 hours rest

**Example:**
- Drill: Saturday-Sunday
- Return home: Sunday 6 PM
- Report to work: Monday (next workday)

**31-180 days (annual training, short deployment):**
- Report: Within 14 days after completion

**Example:**
- Training: June 1-15 (15 days)
- Return home: June 15
- Report to work: By June 29 (14 days later)

**181+ days (long deployment):**
- Report: Within 90 days after completion

**Example:**
- Deployment: Jan 1 - Dec 31 (365 days)
- Return home: Dec 31
- Report to work: By March 31 (90 days later)

**Medical recovery:**
- If hospitalized/injured, deadline extended (up to 2 years for recovery)

### 4. Health Insurance Continuation

**Employer must:**
- Continue health insurance during military service (if you pay your share of premiums)
- If service <31 days: Must continue coverage (no gaps)
- If service >31 days: Can require you pay up to 102% of premium

**TRICARE:**
- Active duty: You have TRICARE (may not need employer insurance)
- Drilling Guard/Reserve: May need employer insurance (TRICARE Reserve Select costs $50-$250/month)

**After reemployment:**
- Health insurance resumes immediately (no waiting period)
- Pre-existing conditions covered (can't deny coverage)

### 5. Pension & 401(k) Contributions

**Employer must:**
- Resume pension contributions (as if you never left)
- Make up missed employer 401(k) match (if you were deployed)

**Example:**
- You contributed 5% to 401(k), employer matched 5%
- Deployed 12 months (contributed $0)
- Return: Employer owes $3,000 match (for year you were gone)

**You can:**
- Make up your contributions (within 3× length of service)
- Example: 12-month deployment = You have 36 months to make up contributions

## Protections Against Discrimination

### Can't Be Fired for Military Service

**Illegal:**
- ❌ "We're firing you because you deploy too much"
- ❌ "Your military service disrupts our business"
- ❌ "We need someone more reliable" (implying military = unreliable)

**Legal:**
- ✅ Can be fired for cause (performance, misconduct) UNRELATED to military
- ✅ Can be fired during company-wide layoff (if based on seniority, not military status)

**Burden of proof:**
- If fired near deployment/return: Employer must prove military was NOT the reason

### Can't Be Denied Hiring for Military Status

**Illegal questions in interview:**
- ❌ "Are you in the Guard/Reserve?" (can't ask before job offer)
- ❌ "Will you deploy?" (discriminatory)

**Legal:**
- ✅ After job offer: Can ask about military obligations (to plan for absences)

**If you volunteer info:**
- "I'm in the National Guard, I drill one weekend/month and 2 weeks/year"
- Employer can ask follow-up (now that YOU brought it up)

**Recommendation:**
- Don't volunteer unless asked (after job offer)
- If asked: Be honest (USERRA protects you)

## Filing USERRA Complaint

### When to File

**Employer violates USERRA if:**
- Refuses to reemploy you (after qualifying military service)
- Fires you for military service
- Demotes you upon return (without cause)
- Denies benefits (pension, health insurance, seniority)
- Discriminates in hiring/promotion (because of military)

### How to File

**Step 1: Document**
- Save: Orders, notice you gave employer, communications, termination letter
- Timeline: Dates of service, return, reemployment request, employer response

**Step 2: Contact ESGR**
- **Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve**
- **Phone:** 800-336-4590
- **Free services:** Mediation, legal guidance, employer education

**Step 3: Informal resolution**
- ESGR ombudsman contacts employer
- Often resolves (employer didn't know law, agrees to comply)
- 60-70% resolved at this stage

**Step 4: Formal complaint (if unresolved)**
- File with Department of Labor (VETS - Veterans' Employment and Training Service)
- DOL investigates
- If violation found: Employer must comply

**Step 5: Lawsuit (if employer still refuses)**
- Free legal representation (ESGR, private attorneys often pro bono for USERRA)
- Court orders employer to comply
- You get: Back pay, benefits, attorney fees, possible damages

**Timeline:** 3-18 months (informal resolution faster, lawsuit slower)

## Common USERRA Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Employer Fires You Before Deployment

**What happened:**
- You notify employer: "I deploy in 3 months"
- Employer fires you 2 weeks later ("We're eliminating your position")

**USERRA analysis:**
- Timing suspicious (fired right after notification)
- Burden on employer to prove military NOT the reason
- Likely: USERRA violation

**Action:**
- File ESGR complaint
- Likely outcome: Employer must rehire + back pay

### Scenario 2: Employer Demotes You Upon Return

**What happened:**
- You: Manager before deployment
- Deploy 12 months
- Return: Offered entry-level position ("We filled your management role")

**USERRA violation:**
- Must be reemployed at same or better position
- Demotion = violation (unless position truly eliminated + no similar positions available)

**Action:**
- File ESGR complaint
- Likely outcome: Restored to manager OR equivalent role + back pay for difference

### Scenario 3: Employer Denies Interview Because of Guard Status

**What happened:**
- Apply for job
- Interview: "Are you in the Guard?"
- You: "Yes, I drill 1 weekend/month"
- Employer: "Sorry, we need someone who's always available" (rejects you)

**USERRA violation:**
- Can't discriminate in hiring based on military status

**Action:**
- File EEOC complaint + USERRA complaint
- Possible outcome: Employer must hire + back pay (from date you should have been hired)
