# Military to Federal Job Conversion: Complete GS Scale & Veterans Preference Guide

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Veterans get massive advantages for federal jobs: 5-10 point preference, special hiring authorities, and direct conversion formulas from military rank to GS grade. Most service members can start at GS-9 to GS-12 (equivalent to $60,000-$90,000/year). USAJobs.gov is where ALL federal jobs are posted — nowhere else.

## Why Federal Jobs Are Perfect for Veterans

### Job Security
- Nearly impossible to get fired (after probation)
- Stable paychecks
- No layoffs during recessions

### Benefits
- Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) — often better than TRICARE
- Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) — yes, the same one!
- Federal pension (after 5 years)
- 26 days paid leave per year (after 3 years)

### Veterans Preference
- You get 5-10 extra points on applications
- You go to the front of the line
- Special hiring authorities bypass competition

## How to Apply for Federal Jobs (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Create USAJobs Account
1. Go to [USAJobs.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov)
2. Click "Create Account"
3. Use Login.gov to verify identity
4. Complete your profile (100% — this matters!)

### Step 2: Build Your Federal Resume
**Federal resumes are DIFFERENT from civilian resumes:**
- ❌ NOT 1-2 pages (federal resumes are 5-10 pages!)
- ✅ Include EVERYTHING: dates, hours per week, supervisor names, duties
- ✅ Use keywords from job announcement
- ✅ Quantify achievements

**Template sections:**
- Contact info
- Work experience (list EVERY job with detailed duties)
- Education
- Certifications
- Awards & honors
- Volunteer work
- Training

### Step 3: Upload Documents
- DD-214 (proof of service)
- VA disability letter (if claiming preference)
- Transcripts (if applying based on education)
- SF-50 (if you were previously federal employee)

### Step 4: Search for Jobs
**Filters to use:**
- "Veterans" (to see veteran-specific jobs)
- GS grade (match your target grade)
- Location (or "remote" for telework)
- Agency (pick ones you're interested in)

### Step 5: Apply to 10-20 Jobs
**Reality check:**
- Federal hiring is SLOW (3-12 months from application to offer)
- Apply to MANY jobs (not just 1-2)
- Follow-up doesn't speed things up (be patient)

### Step 6: Wait for Responses
**What you'll see:**
- "Received" — Your application was submitted
- "Reviewed" — HR looked at it
- "Referred" — You made the cert list! (top candidates sent to hiring manager)
- "Not Referred" — You didn't make the cut (apply to more jobs)
- "Selected" — Congrats! Offer coming

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### ❌ Mistake #1: Using Civilian Resume Format
**Reality:** 1-page resume gets auto-rejected.

**Fix:** Create 5-10 page federal resume with detailed duties.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Claiming Veterans Preference
**Reality:** You don't get preference unless you upload DD-214.

**Fix:** Upload DD-214 and select "Veterans Preference" on every application.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Applying to Only 1-2 Jobs
**Reality:** Federal hiring is competitive and slow. 1-2 applications = 0-1 interviews.

**Fix:** Apply to 20+ jobs over 3 months.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Using Keywords from Job Announcement
**Reality:** HR screens applications with keyword search. No keywords = auto-rejection.

**Fix:** Copy/paste keywords from "Qualifications" section into your resume.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Giving Up After "Not Referred"
**Reality:** "Not Referred" doesn't mean you're not qualified — it means others scored higher.

**Fix:** Keep applying. Each application teaches you how to write better federal resumes.
