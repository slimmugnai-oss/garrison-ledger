# Winter PCS: Complete Guide to Moving in Snow, Ice & Cold Weather

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Winter PCS (Nov-Mar) poses unique challenges: Snow delays (moving trucks stuck), frozen pipes during transit, damaged electronics from cold, road closures extending travel time 2-5 days. Preparation: Book movers 90+ days ahead (limited winter availability), winterize vehicle (antifreeze, snow tires), pack cold-sensitive items in car (not moving truck), allow extra travel days (weather delays), have emergency kit (blankets, food, flashlight). Weight estimate increases 10-15% (winter clothes, coats, boots vs. summer gear). Insurance critical - document pre-existing damage, file claims within 75 days.

## Why Winter PCS Is Different

### Challenges Unique to Winter Moves

**Weather delays:**
- Snowstorms delay movers (1-7 days)
- Ice storms close roads (can't travel)
- Extreme cold = movers work slower (frozen hands, taking breaks)

**Damage risk:**
- Electronics freeze in unheated truck
- Liquids freeze/expand (burst pipes, shampoo bottles)
- Wood furniture cracks (temperature swings)
- Cars damaged (ice, salt on roads during transport)

**Travel complications:**
- Roads closed (blizzards, ice)
- Rental trucks harder to drive (ice, snow)
- Hotel availability (snow storms = everyone stops)
- Flight cancellations (if flying to new duty station)

**Limited mover availability:**
- Most people PCS in summer (May-Aug)
- Fewer moving companies work winter
- Higher prices (limited supply)

**Weight increase:**
- Winter clothes heavier (coats, boots, winter gear)
- 10-15% more weight vs. summer PCS

## Timeline: Winter PCS Planning

### 120 Days Before (Critical for Winter)

**Book movers EARLY:**
- Summer PCS: 60 days ahead = OK
- Winter PCS: 90-120 days ahead = NECESSARY (limited availability)

**TMO appointment:**
- Get orders, start paperwork immediately
- Don't wait until last minute

### 90 Days Before

**Winterize old residence:**
- Arrange utilities shutoff (but keep heat on until moving day to prevent frozen pipes)
- If selling: Heat on until sold (frozen pipe = $10,000+ damage)

**Research new duty station weather:**
- Moving to Alaska from Florida? Buy winter gear NOW (cheaper before you need it)

### 60 Days Before

**Vehicle preparation:**
- Snow tires (if moving to snowy location)
- Antifreeze check
- Battery test (cold kills batteries)
- Emergency kit (blankets, food, shovel, ice scraper)

**Pack strategy:**
- Cold-sensitive items in car (NOT moving truck)
- Label "Temperature Sensitive" boxes

### 30 Days Before

**Weather monitoring:**
- Check 10-day forecast for moving day
- Be flexible (if blizzard forecast, ask TMO about changing dates)

**Backup plan:**
- What if movers can't come? (hotel for extra days)
- What if roads close? (alternate route mapped)

## Packing for Winter PCS

### Cold-Sensitive Items (Pack in Car, NOT Moving Truck)

**Electronics:**
- Laptops, tablets (lithium batteries damaged by extreme cold)
- TVs (LCD screens crack in freezing temps)
- Gaming consoles
- Hard drives (data corruption from cold)

**Liquids:**
- Shampoo, conditioner (expand when frozen, burst bottles)
- Medications (some temperature-sensitive)
- Cleaning supplies
- Paint (ruined if frozen)

**Valuable/Irreplaceable:**
- Photos, important documents
- Jewelry, heirlooms
- Anything you can't afford to lose to cold damage

**Musical instruments:**
- Guitars (wood cracks in cold/dry)
- Pianos (tuning destroyed by temperature swings)
- Brass/woodwinds (pads damaged)

### Winterizing Household Goods for Moving Truck

**Furniture:**
- Wrap in moving blankets (insulation from cold)
- Leather furniture (protect from cracking in dry cold)
- Wood furniture (seal with furniture wax before packing)

**Appliances:**
- Washer/dryer: Drain ALL water (frozen water = cracked hoses, pumps)
- Dishwasher: Drain completely
- Refrigerator: Defrost 48 hours ahead, drain, dry completely

**Plants:**
- Most won't survive winter PCS in moving truck
- Give to friends or sell (cheaper than replacing dead plants)
- Exception: Move in your car with heat on

## Moving Day in Winter

### If It Snows on Moving Day

**Light snow (<2 inches):**
- Movers usually work (slower pace)
- Shovel walkways, driveway (before movers arrive)
- Salt/sand icy steps (prevent mover injuries)

**Heavy snow (>6 inches) or blizzard:**
- Movers may cancel (safety)
- Reschedule for next available day
- You may need hotel (keep moving-day essentials accessible)

**What movers WON'T do:**
- Shovel your driveway/walkways
- Work in unsafe ice conditions
- Drive in white-out conditions

**Your responsibility:**
- Clear paths before movers arrive
- Provide dry area for breaks (garage, covered porch)
- Be flexible with timing (weather delays happen)

### Protecting Belongings on Moving Day

**Cover walkways:**
- Plastic sheeting or tarps (protect boxes from snow/slush)
- Movers will track snow inside (expect wet floors)

**Temperature-sensitive items:**
- Load last, unload first (minimize cold exposure)
- OR take in your car

**Document everything:**
- Photos of items before loading (cold damage = harder to prove than normal damage)
- Note weather conditions on inventory ("Loaded in snowstorm, 15°F")

## Driving Cross-Country in Winter

### Route Planning

**Avoid mountain passes if possible:**
- I-70 through Rockies = closed frequently (avalanche danger, ice)
- I-80 through Wyoming = treacherous (high winds, ice, closures)
- I-90 through Montana/Dakotas = extreme cold (-30°F windchill)

**Safer winter routes:**
- I-40 (southern route, warmer)
- I-10 (southernmost, rarely snow)

**Check road conditions:**
- 511 (dial from cell phone for state road conditions)
- Weather.gov (National Weather Service)
- Waze (real-time user reports)

### Winter Driving Kit (Essential)

**In trunk:**
- ✅ Blankets (2-3 wool or fleece)
- ✅ Non-perishable food (granola bars, water, nuts)
- ✅ Flashlight + extra batteries
- ✅ Jumper cables
- ✅ Ice scraper, snow brush
- ✅ Small shovel (collapsible)
- ✅ Bag of sand or cat litter (traction if stuck)
- ✅ Road flares or reflective triangles
- ✅ Phone charger (car + portable battery)
- ✅ First aid kit

**Why this matters:**
- Stranded in snowstorm = potentially overnight wait for help
- Blankets, food = survival

### If You Get Stuck in Snow

**Don't panic:**
1. Stay with vehicle (don't wander in blizzard)
2. Call 911 (give location, situation)
3. Run engine 10 min/hour for heat (crack window to prevent carbon monoxide)
4. Use blankets, huddle together
5. Wait for help

**Preventing getting stuck:**
- Don't drive in blizzards (stop at hotel)
- Allow extra days (weather delays are normal)

## Common Winter PCS Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Booking Movers Too Late

**Reality:**
- Try to book movers 30 days before winter PCS
- All winter movers booked
- Forced to move yourself in rental truck (dangerous in snow/ice if inexperienced)

**Fix:** Book 90-120 days ahead (winter = limited mover availability)

### ❌ Mistake #2: Packing Liquids/Electronics in Moving Truck

**Reality:**
- Pack laptop, shampoo, paint in moving truck
- Truck sits in -10°F for 3 days during snowstorm
- Laptop ruined, bottles burst

**Fix:** Cold-sensitive items in heated car

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Allowing Extra Travel Time

**Reality:**
- Plan 3-day drive (Texas to Alaska)
- Snowstorm in Canada delays 2 days
- Miss report date, commander not happy

**Fix:** Add 2-5 buffer days for winter PCS travel

### ❌ Mistake #4: Selling Winter Clothes Before PCS to Cold Location

**Reality:**
- PCS from Florida to Alaska
- Sell/donate winter coats ("I don't need these in Florida")
- Arrive in Alaska with no winter gear
- Spend $2,000 on coats, boots, gloves

**Fix:** Keep winter gear if moving to cold climate (even if you don't need it NOW)

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Winterizing Appliances

**Reality:**
- Don't drain washing machine before movers pack
- Water freezes in hoses during transport
- Washer arrives with cracked pump ($500 replacement)

**Fix:** Drain ALL water from appliances (washer, dishwasher, fridge)

## Destination Preparation (New Duty Station)

### Before You Arrive

**Research local winter:**
- Average temps, snowfall
- What gear locals use (studded tires, block heaters, etc.)

**Order winter essentials ahead:**
- Amazon ship to new address (arrives before you do)
- Snow shovel, ice melt, warm bedding

### First Week at New (Cold) Duty Station

**Vehicle:**
- Get snow tires (local shop, usually required by law in some states)
- Engine block heater (Alaska, North Dakota = necessary for -40°F mornings)

**Housing:**
- Space heaters (if government quarters/base housing is drafty)
- Humidifier (winter = dry indoor air)
- Weatherstripping windows (reduce heating bills)

**Clothing:**
- Layering system (base layer, insulation, waterproof shell)
- Boots rated for local temps (Alaska = -40°F rated boots)
- Gloves, hats, scarves

## Insurance & Damage Claims (Winter-Specific)

### Cold-Damage Claims

**Common winter damage:**
- Frozen/burst liquid containers
- Electronics damaged by cold
- Furniture cracks (wood, leather)
- Water damage (frozen pipes in truck/house)

**How to file:**
1. Note damage on delivery inventory (immediately)
2. Take photos (damaged item + weather conditions if relevant)
3. Get repair estimates
4. File claim within 75 days (Full Replacement Value) or 9 months (depreciated)

**Proving cold damage:**
- Weather records (show it was -10°F during transit)
- Moving company GPS tracking (truck sat in cold for X days)
- Expert opinion (electronics repairman confirms "cold damage")

**Common denial:**
- "Improper packing" (movers claim you packed liquid wrong, not cold damage)

**Fight it:**
- Show movers packed it (you didn't)
- Show weather was extreme (not your fault)
- Appeal denial
