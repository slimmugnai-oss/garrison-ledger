# POV Shipping During PCS: Complete Vehicle Transport Guide (CONUS & OCONUS)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** POV (Personally Owned Vehicle) shipping is authorized FREE for OCONUS PCS (Hawaii, Alaska, Europe, Asia). CONUS PCS = you drive or pay yourself ($1,000-$2,000 to ship cross-country). Book POV shipping 60-90 days before PCS (high demand in summer PCS season). Preparation: 1/4 tank gas, remove personal items, clean interior, document pre-existing damage. Shipping time: 6-12 weeks OCONUS, 1-2 weeks CONUS (if you pay). Most issues: minor scratches/dings during loading (file claim within 75 days). Alternatives: Sell car before PCS, buy at new location.

- Get it fixed OR
- Sell it (can't ship inoperable vehicle)

### Pre-Shipping Checklist

**30 Days Before Drop-Off:**

**1. Clean vehicle (inside + out)**

- Remove: GPS, radar detector, phone chargers, sunglasses, CDs

**4. Disable car alarm**

- Fire safety regulation
- More than 1/4 tank = rejected at VPC

**6. Disconnect battery (sometimes required)**
- Check with VPC (depends on destination)

**7. Fix minor issues**

## Destination-Specific Requirements

### Japan POV Requirements

**Left-hand drive OK** (but inconvenient on right-side roads)

**Must meet Japanese safety standards (JCI):**
- Emissions standards (most newer cars pass)
- Size restrictions (oversized vehicles = expensive inspections)
- Modifications (lowered, lifted, tinted = often fail)

**Documents needed:**
- Bill of sale (or title)
- EPA form (emissions compliance)
- SOFA plates (apply through base)

**Popular cars in Japan:**
- Compact cars (Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla)
- NOT popular: Full-size trucks, SUVs (expensive gas, narrow roads)

**Recommendation:** Sell US vehicle, buy Japanese car (better for local driving)

### Europe POV Requirements

**Left-hand drive = PERFECT** (Europe drives on right like US)

**Must meet European safety standards:**
- Headlights (may need adjustment for right-side traffic)
- Emissions (most newer US cars pass)

**Popular cars in Europe:**
- Compact cars (Volkswagen, Ford Focus, Honda Civic)
- NOT: Full-size trucks (huge, expensive gas)

**Gas prices:**
- $6-$8/gallon (vs. $3-$4 US)

**Recommendation:** Ship small fuel-efficient car OR buy European car

### Hawaii POV Requirements

**Safety inspection required:**

- $25 fee
- Most cars pass (stricter than some states, easier than others)

### Alaska POV Requirements

## Common POV Shipping Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Booking Too Late

**Reality:**
- Book POV shipping 2 weeks before PCS (summer PCS season)
- No slots available
- Ship fills up, your car waits 4-6 weeks for next ship

**Fix:** Book 60-90 days ahead (especially May-August)

### ❌ Mistake #2: Leaving Personal Items in Car

**Reality:**
- Leave laptop, tools, clothes in trunk
- Customs finds it
- Vehicle quarantined, items confiscated, possible fine

**Fix:** EMPTY the vehicle (only spare tire, jack, manual allowed)

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Documenting Pre-Existing Damage

**Reality:**
- Don't take photos before shipping
- Vehicle arrives with scratch
- Can't prove it wasn't there before
- Claim denied

**Fix:** Photos from ALL angles BEFORE drop-off (timestamp)

### ❌ Mistake #4: Shipping Car That's Not Worth It

**Reality:**
- Ship 2005 Tahoe to Japan (worth $5,000)
- Shipping value: $0 (government pays)
- Japan: Gas $8/gallon, can't fit in parking spaces, fail inspection ($2,000 to fix)
- Sell at loss

**Fix:** Consider selling + buying suitable vehicle for new location
