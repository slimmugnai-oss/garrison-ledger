# Depression & Anxiety in Military: Symptoms, Treatment & When to Get Help

**Bottom Line Up Front:** 20-30% of service members experience depression or anxiety (vs. 8-10% general population). Symptoms: Persistent sadness, loss of interest, irritability, panic attacks, constant worry, sleep issues, difficulty concentrating. Treatment works: 60-80% improve with therapy (CBT) + medication (SSRIs like Zoloft, Lexapro). Free resources: Military OneSource (24/7), base Mental Health clinic, TRICARE (covers unlimited sessions). Seeking help does NOT ruin career - thousands serve with treated depression/anxiety. Untreated = job performance decline, relationship problems, substance abuse, suicide risk. Get help early.

## Depression vs. Anxiety (Understanding the Difference)

### Depression Symptoms

**Emotional:**
- Persistent sadness, emptiness ("nothing makes me happy")
- Loss of interest (hobbies, activities, sex - all feel pointless)
- Hopelessness ("things will never get better")
- Guilt, worthlessness ("I'm a failure," "everyone would be better without me")

**Physical:**
- Fatigue (exhausted despite sleeping)
- Sleep changes (sleeping 12+ hours OR insomnia)
- Appetite changes (eating way more or way less)
- Aches, pains (no medical cause)
- Slowed movements, speech

**Behavioral:**
- Social withdrawal (isolating from friends, family)
- Declining performance (work, PT, duties)
- Substance use (drinking to cope)
- Suicidal thoughts

**Duration:** Symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for 2+ weeks = clinical depression

### Anxiety Symptoms

**Emotional:**
- Excessive worry (can't stop worrying about everything)
- Fear, dread (feeling like something terrible will happen)
- Irritability, on-edge feeling
- Difficulty concentrating ("brain fog")

**Physical:**
- Rapid heartbeat, pounding heart
- Sweating (even when not hot)
- Trembling, shaking
- Shortness of breath
- Nausea, stomach issues
- Dizziness, lightheadedness

**Panic Attacks:**
- Sudden intense fear
- Feel like you're dying, having heart attack
- Lasts 10-30 minutes
- Physically exhausting

**Behavioral:**
- Avoidance (avoiding situations that trigger anxiety)
- Reassurance-seeking ("Am I OK? Tell me I'm OK")
- Hypervigilance (always scanning for threats)

### Both Depression AND Anxiety (Common)

**50% of people with depression also have anxiety**
- Feel hopeless (depression) + constant worry (anxiety)
- Treatment addresses both

## Why Military Rates Are Higher

### Unique Stressors

**Combat exposure:**
- Seeing death, violence
- Hypervigilance (always alert for danger)
- Survivor's guilt ("why did I live and they died?")

**Frequent moves:**
- Uproot every 2-3 years
- Lose social support (friends, community)
- Spouse/kids stressed (affects family)

**Work pressure:**
- Long hours, shift work
- High-stakes decisions (lives depend on you)
- Toxic leadership (abusive commanders)

**Separation:**
- Deployments (away from family 6-12 months)
- TDY, training (away weeks/months)
- Relationship strain

**Stigma:**
- "Suck it up" culture
- Fear of appearing weak
- Career concerns (think help = end of career)

**Result:** High stress, limited support, stigma = higher depression/anxiety rates

## When to Get Help (Red Flags)

### Mild vs. Clinical (When It's a Problem)

**Normal stress response (NOT clinical depression/anxiety):**
- Sad for 1-2 days after stressful event
- Anxious before big event (promotion board, deployment)
- Bounce back within days/weeks

**Clinical depression/anxiety (NEEDS treatment):**
- Symptoms most days for 2+ weeks
- Interferes with life (work, relationships, daily tasks)
- Not improving on own
- Thoughts of self-harm

### Warning Signs to Seek Help Immediately

**Depression:**
- ⚠️ Suicidal thoughts ("I want to die," "everyone would be better without me")
- ⚠️ Self-harm (cutting, burning)
- ⚠️ Complete withdrawal (not leaving house, ignoring everyone)
- ⚠️ Can't perform basic tasks (showering, eating, going to work)

**Anxiety:**
- ⚠️ Panic attacks multiple times per week
- ⚠️ Avoiding work, relationships, life (due to anxiety)
- ⚠️ Physical symptoms severe (chest pain, can't breathe)
- ⚠️ Substance abuse (self-medicating anxiety with alcohol/drugs)

## Treatment Options (All Free via TRICARE)

### Therapy (First-Line Treatment)

**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - Most Effective**

**What it is:**
- Identify negative thought patterns
- Challenge and change them
- Develop coping skills
- 12-20 sessions (weekly)

**Effectiveness:** 60-70% improvement

**Example:**
- Negative thought: "I'm a failure, I'll never succeed"

- Alternative: "I've succeeded before, this setback doesn't define me"

**Where to get:**
- Base Mental Health clinic
- TRICARE civilian network therapist
- Military OneSource (12 free sessions/year)

**Other effective therapies:**
- Interpersonal therapy (relationship-focused)
- Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
- Mindfulness-based therapy

### Medication (Often Combined with Therapy)

**SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) - First Choice**

**Common SSRIs:**
- Sertraline (Zoloft) - most prescribed for military
- Escitalopram (Lexapro)
- Fluoxetine (Prozac)
- Paroxetine (Paxil)

**How they work:**
- Increase serotonin (brain chemical regulating mood)
- Take 4-6 weeks to work (not immediate)
- Continue for 6-12 months minimum (even after feeling better)

**Effectiveness:** 50-60% see significant improvement

**Side effects (usually temporary):**
- Nausea, headache (first 1-2 weeks)
- Sleep changes
- Sexual side effects (20-30% of people)

**Military concerns:**
- Flight status: Some medications disqualifying (check with flight surgeon)
- Weapons qualification: Usually OK (if medication working and you're stable)
- Deployment: Can deploy while on medication (bring adequate supply)

**SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors)**
- Venlafaxine (Effexor)
- Duloxetine (Cymbalta)
- Used if SSRIs don't work

**Benzodiazepines (For Severe Anxiety) - SHORT-TERM ONLY**
- Alprazolam (Xanax)
- Lorazepam (Ativan)
- Clonazepam (Klonopin)
- **Risk:** Highly addictive, military often avoids long-term use
- **Use:** Short-term (2-4 weeks) while waiting for SSRIs to kick in

### Lifestyle Changes (Complement Treatment)

**Exercise:**
- 30+ minutes, 5x/week
- Reduces depression by 20-30% (as effective as medication for mild depression)
- Reduces anxiety significantly

**Sleep hygiene:**
- 7-9 hours/night
- Same bedtime/wake time
- No screens 1 hour before bed

**Limit alcohol:**
- Alcohol = depressant (makes depression worse)
- Interferes with medications

**Social connection:**
- Isolation = worsens depression
- Force yourself to see friends, family (even when you don't want to)

## Career Impact (Will Help Ruin My Career?)

### The Truth

**Seeking help does NOT automatically:**
- ❌ End your career
- ❌ Result in discharge
- ❌ Lose security clearance
- ❌ Get you kicked out

**What CAN affect career:**
- ✅ Refusing needed treatment (shows poor judgment)
- ✅ Untreated mental health destroying job performance
- ✅ Substance abuse (self-medicating instead of getting help)
- ✅ Suicidal behavior without seeking treatment

**Reality:**
- Thousands serve with treated depression/anxiety
- Many hold Top Secret clearances while on medication
- Many deploy while in treatment/on medication

### When Treatment MIGHT Affect Career

**Medical discharge (rare):**
- Condition so severe you can't perform duties
- Multiple hospitalizations
- Doesn't respond to treatment

**Flight status (pilots, aircrew):**
- Some medications disqualifying (temporarily or permanently)
- Discuss with flight surgeon before starting medication

**Deployment (rare deferral):**
- If starting new medication (may defer deployment until stable)
- If in crisis (stabilize first, then deploy)

**Security clearance (very rare):**
- Only if: Untreated psychosis, refusing treatment, current suicidal ideation
- Treated depression/anxiety = usually fine (see Security Clearance guide)
