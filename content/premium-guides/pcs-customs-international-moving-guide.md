# PCS Customs & International Moving: Clearing Household Goods Through Foreign Customs

**Bottom Line Up Front:** OCONUS PCS requires customs clearance at destination country. Process: HHG arrives at port, customs inspects, releases (or holds for inspection/taxes). Timeline: 2-8 weeks from ship arrival to delivery. Prohibited items: Firearms, certain foods, plants, alcohol (varies by country). Required documents: Orders, passport, customs forms, inventory list. Common delays: Missing paperwork, prohibited items found, agricultural inspection. Costs: $0 for authorized military shipments (government pays), but personal import taxes possible for excess items. Japan/Germany/Korea have specific restrictions - research 60+ days ahead.

## Customs Process Overview

### What Is Customs Clearance?

**Definition:** Foreign government inspection of your belongings before allowing them into the country

**Purpose:**
- Prevent prohibited items (weapons, drugs, agricultural threats)

**Timeline:**

- Customs inspects (1-5 days)
- Release to moving company
- Delivery to your residence (7-14 days)

## Customs Inspection Process

### What Happens at Foreign Port

**Step 1: Ship arrives**
- HHG unloaded from ship
- Moved to customs warehouse

**Step 2: Customs review (1-5 days)**
- Paperwork reviewed
- Decision: Full inspection OR random spot check OR clearance without opening

**Step 3A: No inspection (Best case)**
- Customs clears shipment based on paperwork
- Released to moving company
- Delivery scheduled

**Step 3B: Spot check (Common)**
- Open 10-20% of boxes
- Look for prohibited items, verify inventory accuracy
- If all clear → release (adds 1-3 days)

**Step 3C: Full inspection (Rare, or if issues found)**
- Open ALL boxes
- Thorough search
- Can take 5-14 days
- Usually triggered by: Missing paperwork, previous violations, random selection

### If Prohibited Items Found

**Scenario 1: Minor (Non-criminal)**
- Example: Bottle of liquor over limit, wooden cutting board (Japan agricultural)
- **Result:** Item confiscated, small fine or warning
- **Impact:** Delays clearance 2-7 days

**Scenario 2: Serious (Criminal)**
- Example: Firearm, drugs, large quantity contraband
- **Result:** Criminal investigation, possible arrest, discharge from military
- **Impact:** Career-ending

**Don't risk it:** If in doubt, don't ship it

## Common Customs Delays & How to Avoid

### Delay #1: Missing/Incorrect Paperwork

**Cause:**
- Lost inventory list
- Orders don't match shipment paperwork
- Missing customs forms

**Prevention:**
- Keep copies of ALL documents (digital + physical)
- Verify paperwork before shipment leaves US

**Fix if it happens:**
- Email copies to TMO, moving company, customs broker
- May delay clearance 7-14 days

### Delay #2: Prohibited Items Found

**Cause:**
- Didn't know item was prohibited
- Movers packed something you didn't know about

**Prevention:**
- Purge before pack-out (go through EVERYTHING)
- Tell movers: "Don't pack [specific items]"
- Research destination country restrictions 60+ days ahead

**Fix if it happens:**
- Item confiscated (you don't get it back)
- Possible fine
- Clearance delayed 3-10 days

### Delay #3: Agricultural Inspection (Japan, Australia, New Zealand)

**Cause:**
- Wooden furniture, plants, food items trigger inspection

**Prevention:**
- Limit wood items (or accept delay)
- Don't ship plants (give away before PCS)
- No food items in HHG

**Fix if it happens:**
- Wait for agricultural inspection (1-2 weeks)
- Items may be fumigated (adds cost, time)
- Items may be destroyed (no compensation)

## Taxes & Duties (When You Have to Pay)

### Duty-Free Personal Effects

**Usually exempt from taxes:**
- Used household goods (furniture, clothes, kitchenware)
- Personal items (books, toys, decorations)
- Reasonable quantity

**Why:** Military diplomatic clearance + SOFA agreement (Status of Forces Agreement)

### Taxable Items

**May be taxed:**
- New items (still in box, tags attached)
- Excessive quantity (10 TVs, 50 pairs of shoes = commercial import)
- Luxury goods (expensive jewelry, designer items)
- Vehicles (separate rules, often taxed)

**Tax rates:**
- Europe: 19-25% VAT
- Asia: 5-10% import duty + local consumption tax
- Can be $500-$5,000+ depending on value

**How to avoid:**
- Don't ship excessive new items
- If buying new stuff, remove packaging before shipment (looks "used")
