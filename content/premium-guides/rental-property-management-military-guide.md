# Rental Property Management for Military: Long-Distance Landlording Complete Guide

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Military landlords face unique challenge: PCS every 2-3 years = managing rentals from 1,000+ miles away. Solution: Hire property manager (8-10% of rent + $500-$1,000 leasing fee) or use DIY systems (tenant screening, maintenance network, online rent collection). Screen tenants ruthlessly (credit 650+, income 3x rent, references). Budget 10% rent for maintenance, 8% vacancy, 10% property manager = 28% total expenses. Cash flow formula: Rent - (Mortgage + Taxes + Insurance + Maintenance + Vacancy + PM) = Minimum $100-$200/month profit.

## The Military Landlord Reality

### Why Military Members Become Landlords

**Common path:**
1. Buy house at duty station (VA loan, $0 down)
2. Live there 2-3 years
3. PCS to new location
4. Keep house as rental (rent covers mortgage)
5. Repeat every PCS
6. Retire with 5-8 rental properties

### Challenges of Long-Distance Landlording

**Problem 1: You're in California, Rental in North Carolina**
- Can't show property to tenants
- Can't handle repairs personally
- Can't collect rent in person
- Can't evict (if needed) without local presence

**Problem 2: Deployments**
- 6-12 months unavailable
- Tenant emergency? Can't respond
- Need systems/people to handle everything

**Problem 3: Time Zones**
- You're in Japan (JST), rental in Texas (CST)
- 14-hour time difference = communication delays

**Solutions:**
- Hire property manager (most common)
- Build reliable maintenance network
- Use technology (online rent collection, smart locks, cameras)
- Set clear systems BEFORE you PCS

## Property Manager vs. DIY (Decision Framework)

### Hire Property Manager If:

✅ Property is >500 miles away  
✅ You deploy frequently  
✅ You value your time  
✅ You have multiple properties  
✅ You're risk-averse (PM handles legal compliance)

**Cost:** 8-10% of monthly rent + leasing fees

**Example:**
- Rent: $1,800/month
- PM fee: 10% = $180/month ($2,160/year)
- Leasing fee: $1,800 (when new tenant found)
- **Total annual cost: $2,160-$3,960** (depending on tenant turnover)

### DIY If:

✅ Property is local (<50 miles)  
✅ You're not deploying soon  
✅ You enjoy managing (some people do)  
✅ You have reliable handyman network  
✅ You want to maximize cash flow

**Savings:** $2,000-$4,000/year (no PM fees)

**Time commitment:** 5-10 hours/month (more during tenant turnover)

## Maintenance Budgeting & Cash Flow

### The 50% Rule (Quick Estimate)

**Rule:** Expenses (not including mortgage) = 50% of rent

**Example:**
- Rent: $1,800/month
- Expenses: $900/month (maintenance, property tax, insurance, vacancy, PM)
- Mortgage: $1,200/month
- **Cash flow: $1,800 - $900 - $1,200 = -$300/month** (NEGATIVE = bad deal)

**This rule helps you avoid bad properties BEFORE buying**

### Detailed Expense Breakdown

**For $1,800/month rent:**

- Property tax: $150/month ($1,800/year)
- Insurance: $100/month
- Maintenance reserve: $180/month (10% of rent)
- Vacancy reserve: $144/month (8% of rent)
- Property manager: $180/month (10% of rent)
- HOA (if applicable): $50/month
- **Total expenses: $804/month**

**Mortgage: $1,200/month**

**Total monthly cost: $2,004**  
**Rent: $1,800**  
**Cash flow: -$204/month** (LOSING MONEY!)

**Fix:** Either increase rent OR don't buy this property

**Minimum cash flow:** $100-$200/month (after ALL expenses)

### Maintenance Emergency Fund

**Build reserve:** $5,000-$10,000 per property

**Covers:**
- AC replacement: $4,000-$7,000
- Roof repair: $1,000-$5,000 (full replacement $10K-$20K)
- Water heater: $800-$1,500
- Appliances: $500-$1,200 each

**How to build:**
- Save 10% of rent monthly
- After 3 years: $6,480 saved ($1,800 × 10% × 36 months)

## Tenant Turnover (Biggest Cost)

### Turnover Costs

**Average turnover: $2,000-$5,000**

**Breakdown:**
- Vacancy (1 month): $1,800 (lost rent)
- Cleaning: $200-$400
- Paint: $500-$1,000 (DIY cheaper)
- Repairs (nail holes, broken items): $300-$800
- Leasing fee (if PM): $1,800
- **Total: $4,600-$6,000**

### How to Reduce Turnover

**1. Keep good tenants (Offer lease renewal incentives)**
- Rent discount: "Renew for 2 years, I'll keep rent flat"
- Small upgrade: "Renew, I'll replace bathroom vanity"

**2. Screen carefully upfront**
- Good tenant = stays 3-5 years
- Bad tenant = leaves after 1 year (or you evict)

**3. Respond to maintenance quickly**
- Tenants leave when maintenance is ignored

**4. Competitive rent**
- Don't overprice (causes vacancy)
- Don't underprice (leaves money on table)

## Common Military Landlord Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Keeping House That Can't Cash Flow as Rental

**Reality:**
- Buy $400,000 house (great while you live there)
- PCS, try to rent
- Mortgage: $2,500/month
- Market rent: $2,200/month
- **Lose $300/month + maintenance = -$500-$800/month**

**Fix:** Sell if rent < mortgage + expenses. Don't keep bad rental for sentimental reasons.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Screening Tenants Thoroughly

**Reality:**
- First person who applies, you rent to them (you want it rented fast)
- They pay late, cause damage, leave after 6 months
- Cost: $5,000+ in repairs + lost rent

**Fix:** Screen thoroughly. Wait for RIGHT tenant, not FIRST tenant.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Trying to DIY Manage from Overseas

**Reality:**
- You're in Germany, rental in Texas
- Tenant: "AC broke, it's 100°F"
- You: (sleeping, time zone difference)
- Tenant: (suffers for 24 hours, withholds rent, leaves)

**Fix:** Hire property manager if you're OCONUS or deploy frequently.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Budgeting for Maintenance

**Reality:**
- Cash flow: $200/month (looks good!)
- AC dies: $5,000 repair
- You have no reserve
- Must sell property or take loan

**Fix:** Save 10% of rent monthly for maintenance. Build $5K-$10K reserve.
