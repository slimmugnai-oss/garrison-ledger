# Parenting Through Deployment: Helping Kids Cope with Military Parent Absence

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Kids react to deployment based on age: Toddlers (0-3) = separation anxiety/regression, School-age (6-12) = worry/anger/fear, Teens (13-18) = acting out/depression. Preparation is key: Talk 2-4 weeks before deployment (not too early, not last minute), create visual calendar (countdown to homecoming), establish communication plan (video calls weekly if possible). Maintain routines during deployment (same bedtime, meal times = stability). Red flags: Grades drop, behavioral changes, withdrawal, sleep issues - seek Military OneSource counseling (free). Homecoming adjustment takes 2-6 months (not instant "back to normal").

## How Deployment Affects Kids by Age

### Infants & Toddlers (0-3 Years)

**What they understand:**
- ❌ Don't understand deployment concept ("Daddy's on a trip for work")
- ✅ Notice parent is gone (separation anxiety)
- ✅ Can sense stress from at-home parent

**Common reactions:**
- Increased clinginess (won't let at-home parent out of sight)
- Regression (potty-trained child has accidents, weaned child wants bottle)
- Sleep disruption (night waking, difficulty falling asleep)
- Behavioral changes (tantrums, aggression)

**How to help:**
- Maintain strict routine (same nap time, meal time, bedtime)
- Extra physical affection (hugs, cuddles, reassurance)
- Deployed parent: Record videos of reading bedtime stories (play nightly)
- Keep deployed parent's photo visible (talk about them daily)
- Be patient with regression (it's temporary, not permanent)

**Communication with deployed parent:**
- Video calls: Keep short (5-10 min) - toddlers have short attention spans
- Frequency: 1-2x/week (if available)
- Don't force it (if child doesn't want to talk, that's OK)

### Preschool (3-5 Years)

**What they understand:**
- ✅ Parent is gone (but may not understand why or for how long)
- ❌ Don't understand time ("6 months" = meaningless)
- ✅ May fear parent won't come back

**Common reactions:**
- "Where's Daddy?" (repeated questioning)
- Fear parent is dead (even if told they're coming home)
- Acting out (hitting, disobedience)
- Nightmares (scary dreams about deployed parent)
- Physical complaints (tummy aches, headaches with no medical cause)

**How to help:**
- Visual calendar (countdown chain: remove one link per day until homecoming)
- Simple explanations ("Daddy's helping other soldiers. He'll come home in [X] sleeps.")
- Deployed parent: Send videos, letters, small gifts (stuffed animal, bracelet)
- Read deployment books (Night Catch, My Red Balloon, Daddy You're My Hero)
- Validate feelings ("I miss Daddy too. It's OK to feel sad.")

**Red flags (seek help):**
- Aggressive behavior (hurting other kids, animals)
- Extreme withdrawal (won't play, talk, interact)
- Persistent nightmares (every night for weeks)

### School-Age (6-12 Years)

**What they understand:**
- ✅ Parent is deployed (concept of military service)
- ✅ Deployment duration (6 months, 12 months)
- ✅ Some danger involved (but don't fully grasp severity)
- ❌ Don't understand geopolitics ("Why is Daddy fighting?")

**Common reactions:**
- Worry/fear (especially if they've seen deployment news)
- Anger ("Why did Daddy leave us?")
- Grief (sadness, crying)
- School problems (grades drop, behavior issues, fights)
- Somatic complaints (headaches, stomach aches)
- Trying to be "the man of the house" or "little adult" (taking on too much responsibility)

**How to help:**
- Honest age-appropriate explanations ("Daddy's deployed to help keep our country safe. Yes, it can be dangerous, but he's trained and careful.")
- Don't overshare ("There was a bombing near his base" = causes panic)
- Encourage expression (journaling, art, talking)
- Maintain expectations (chores, homework, behavior - don't let standards slip)
- Don't make them "replacement parent" (they're still kids, not co-parents)
- Connect with other deployment kids (on-base support groups, school counselor)

**Communication with deployed parent:**
- Video calls: 15-30 min, 1-2x/week
- Letters: Both directions (parent sends, kid writes back)
- Care packages: Kid helps pack (includes drawings, photos)
- Surprises: Deployed parent sends unexpected gifts/letters

**School support:**
- Tell teacher about deployment (they can watch for behavioral changes)
- Some schools have deployment support programs
- Tutoring if grades slip (don't let deployment tank academics)

### Teenagers (13-18 Years)

**What they understand:**
- ✅ Full understanding of deployment, danger, geopolitics
- ✅ May follow news (know about casualties, IEDs, combat)
- ✅ Understand family stress (financial, emotional)

**Common reactions:**
- Anger/resentment ("You chose to deploy and abandon me")
- Acting out (drinking, drugs, skipping school, sexual activity)
- Depression (withdrawal, suicidal thoughts)
- Anxiety (constant worry about deployed parent's safety)
- Taking on too much ("I have to be strong for Mom/Dad")
- Rebellion (pushing boundaries while deployed parent can't enforce)

**How to help:**
- Open communication (don't hide information, but don't overshare graphic details)
- Set clear expectations (rules don't change just because parent deployed)
- Monitor behavior (watch for warning signs: grades, friends, mood)
- Encourage healthy coping (sports, hobbies, friends)
- Family counseling if needed (Military OneSource, TRICARE)
- Let them express anger (it's valid, don't punish feeling, address behavior)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Make them "parent replacement" (taking care of younger siblings is OK, but don't give parental authority)
- ❌ Vent to them (find adult support, not your teen)
- ❌ Let discipline slide ("They're stressed, I'll let it go" = bad precedent)

**Communication with deployed parent:**
- Video calls: 30-60 min, 1-2x/week
- Texting/email (teens prefer this over calls sometimes)
- Social media (some deployed parents can access Facebook)
- Privacy (teen may not want to share everything with deployed parent - that's OK)

## Preparing Kids for Deployment

### Timeline: When to Tell Kids

**2-4 weeks before deployment:**
- Best timeframe (enough time to process, not so far ahead they forget)

**Too early (>6 weeks):**
- Young kids forget or lose sense of time
- Prolonged anxiety (months of worrying)

**Too late (< 1 week):**
- Not enough time to process
- Feels like ambush ("Why didn't you tell me sooner?!")

**How to tell them:**
- Family meeting (all kids together, both parents present if possible)
- Age-appropriate language
- Emphasize: "We'll stay connected" and "I'll come home"
- Answer questions honestly

### Creating Deployment Calendar

**Visual countdown (especially for young kids):**
- Paper chain (remove one link per day)
- Advent-style calendar (flip one number per day)
- Marble jar (move one marble per day from "days left" jar to "days done" jar)
- Calendar with stickers (mark off each day)

**Why visual calendars work:**
- Young kids can't conceptualize time
- Visual = concrete ("I can see we're getting closer to homecoming")

### Communication Plan

**Set realistic expectations:**
- "Daddy will try to call every Sunday, but sometimes he won't be able to" (don't promise daily calls if not possible)
- "Emails might take a few days to arrive"
- "If you don't hear from Daddy for a while, it doesn't mean something's wrong - it means he's busy"

**Deployed parent: Pre-record content:**
- Birthday messages (if you'll miss birthdays)
- Bedtime stories (5-10 videos)
- Encouragement ("I'm proud of you for...")
- Holiday messages (Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.)

---

## During Deployment: Maintaining Stability

### Routine Is Critical

**Keep same schedule:**
- Bedtime: Same time every night
- Meals: Same time, same structure
- School: No changes (unless necessary)
- Activities: Keep kids in sports/hobbies (don't cancel "because we're stressed")

**Why routine matters:**
- Deployment = chaos, unpredictability
- Routine = control, safety, normalcy

### Discipline During Deployment

**Don't let standards slip:**
- Rules stay the same
- Consequences stay the same
- Expectations stay the same

**Common mistake:**
- "They're going through a hard time, I'll let behavioral issues slide"
- Result: Kid acts out more, because boundaries disappeared

**Fix:**
- Empathy + Consistency ("I know you miss Daddy. It's hard. But you still have to [follow rules].")

### Staying Connected to Deployed Parent

**Video calls (if available):**
- Frequency: Weekly (if possible)
- Duration: Age-dependent (5-10 min for toddlers, 30-60 min for teens)
- Preparation: Have kids ready (don't waste call time trying to find them)
- Topics: School, hobbies, friends (normalcy, not just "I miss you")

**Letters/Care packages:**
- Send weekly (even if video calls happen)
- Include photos, drawings, school work
- Deployed parent: Write back (even short notes matter)

**Flat Daddy/Mommy:**
- Life-size photo cutout of deployed parent
- Take to events (soccer games, school, dinner)
- Kids feel parent's "presence"
- Controversial (some think it's weird, others find it comforting)

## Homecoming: The Honeymoon & Reality

### First 48 Hours (Honeymoon Phase)

**What to expect:**
- Excitement, relief, joy
- "Everything's perfect again!"
- Kids on best behavior

**Reality:**
- This doesn't last (adjustment is coming)

### Week 1-2 (Adjustment Begins)

**What happens:**
- Deployed parent tries to resume pre-deployment role
- Kids test boundaries ("You can't tell me what to do, you weren't here!")
- Family dynamics shifted (at-home parent ran household alone, now two parents again)
- Routines disrupted (deployed parent's return = schedule changes)

**Common issues:**
- Kids act out (especially with deployed parent)
- At-home parent feels undermined ("I handled this for 9 months, now you're changing everything!")
- Deployed parent feels left out ("I don't even recognize my own family")

### Months 1-3 (Reintegration)

**What's normal:**
- Behavioral issues (tantrums, disobedience, attitude)
- Kids favoring at-home parent ("I want Mommy, not you!")
- Sleep disruption (again)
- Grades fluctuate

**How to handle:**
- **United front:** Both parents enforce same rules (don't undermine each other)
- **Patience:** Deployed parent, let kids warm up to you (don't force it)
- **Communication:** Daily check-ins between parents (what worked today? what didn't?)
- **Therapy if needed:** Family counseling (helps reintegration)

**Timeline:** 2-6 months for full reintegration

**Remember:** Kids are resilient, but they need support. Age matters (toddlers need routine, teens need communication). Maintain stability during deployment (same rules, schedule, expectations). Watch for warning signs (behavioral changes, grades, mood). Seek help early (Military OneSource is free, 24/7). Homecoming isn't instant "back to normal" - reintegration takes 2-6 months. Be patient.
