## Common Certification Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Getting Cert with No Job Market Demand

**Reality:**
- Get obscure certification ("Certified Widget Specialist")
- No jobs require it
- Wasted $500 + 100 hours

**Fix:** Research job market FIRST (which certs do employers want?)

### ❌ Mistake #2: Collecting Certs Without Experience

**Reality:**
- Get 5 certifications, 0 hands-on experience
- Apply for jobs, get rejected
- "I have certs, why won't they hire me?"

**Truth:** Certs + experience = hired. Certs alone = not enough.

**Fix:** Get 1-2 key certs, get job, gain experience, add more certs

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Maintaining Certifications

**Reality:**
- Get PMP (costs $555 exam)
- Don't maintain (need 60 PDUs over 3 years)
- Cert expires, worthless

**Fix:** Maintain certs (usually requires: Continuing education, renewal fee)

### ❌ Mistake #4: Paying Full Price for Training

**Reality:**
- Pay $3,000 for PMP bootcamp
- Could have used GI Bill (FREE)

**Fix:** Explore GI Bill, VET TEC, free resources before paying
