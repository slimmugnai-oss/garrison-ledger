**PCS #2: Fort Lewis (3 years)**
- Buy: $400,000 house
- Mortgage: $2,530/month
- BAH: $2,700/month

- Cash flow: $270/month after property manager

**PCS #3: Fort Hood (3 years)**
- Buy: $280,000 house
- Similar process...

**After 20-year career:**
- Own 6-7 rental properties
- Total cash flow: $1,000-$2,000/month
- Total equity: $500,000-$1,000,000

## House Hacking vs. Traditional Rental (Which Is Better?)

### House Hacking (Better for Most)

**Pros:**
- Immediate cash flow (tenant pays mortgage)
- Live for free (or get paid to live there)
- Learn landlording while living on-site
- Easier financing (owner-occupied = better rates)

**Cons:**
- Share property with tenants (less privacy)
- Responsible for repairs (even at 2 AM)
- Screening tenants (crucial)

**Best for:** E-5 to E-7, first-time investors, those who want cash flow NOW

### Traditional Buy & Hold (Good for Long-Term)

**Pros:**
- Full privacy (don't live with tenants)
- Property manager handles everything
- Simpler (just collect rent)

**Cons:**
- No immediate cash flow (expenses = rent in early years)
- Profit comes from appreciation + equity (long-term)
- Requires capital for repairs

**Best for:** O-3+, experienced investors, hands-off approach

## Common Military Real Estate Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Buying House You Can't Afford to Rent Out
**Reality:** Buy $500,000 house. PCS. Can only rent for $2,500 (mortgage is $3,200). Lose $700/month.

**Fix:** Buy properties where rent ≥ mortgage + expenses. Use 1% rule (rent should be ≥1% of purchase price).

**1% Rule Example:**
- $300,000 house
- Target rent: $3,000/month
- If market rent is only $2,200 → DON'T BUY

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Using Property Manager
**Reality:** You're stationed in California. Rental is in North Carolina. Tenant has issue. You can't handle it from 3,000 miles away.

**Fix:** Use property manager (8-10% of rent). Worth it for sanity.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Selling Every Time You PCS
**Reality:** Buy house. PCS 3 years later. Sell. Repeat. Never build portfolio.

**Fix:** KEEP properties as rentals. Build portfolio over 20-year career.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Buying in Bad Location
**Reality:** Buy house 45 minutes from base. Can't find military renters. Property sits vacant.

**Fix:** Buy within 20 minutes of base. Military renters prioritize commute time.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Using All 4 VA Loan Uses on Personal Homes
**Reality:** Use VA loan 4 times for homes you live in, sell each time. Miss rental portfolio opportunity.

**Fix:** Use VA loan for investment properties (house hack or keep as rentals).

### DIY Property Management

- Stress (tenant emergencies)

**Best for:** Local properties, first rental, hands-on personality

### Hired Property Manager

**Cost:** 8-10% of monthly rent + leasing fee (usually 1 month's rent for new tenant)

**Example:**
- Rent: $1,800/month
- Management fee: 10% = $180/month
- Leasing fee: $1,800 (when tenant changes)

**What they do:**
- Advertise property
- Screen tenants
- Collect rent

**Best for:** Out-of-state properties, deployed frequently, want hands-off
