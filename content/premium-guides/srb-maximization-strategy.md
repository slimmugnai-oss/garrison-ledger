## Understanding SRB Basics

- **Timing:** Must reenlist before current contract expires

- **Example:** E-5, $41,724 base pay = $104,310 maximum
- **Common:** $15,000-30,000 for most MOSs

### Zone B: Second Reenlistment (6-10 years)
- **Maximum:** 3.5x annual base pay
- **Example:** E-6, $50,000 base pay = $175,000 maximum
- **Common:** $25,000-50,000 for most MOSs

### Zone C: Third Reenlistment (10-14 years)

## The Tax Optimization Strategy

### Understanding SRB Taxation

**SRB is taxed as ordinary income, but there are ways to minimize the tax hit:**

**1. Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE)**
- **If deployed:** SRB is tax-free up to $112,000 (2025 limit)
- **Timing:** Reenlist while deployed for maximum benefit
- **Example:** $50,000 SRB while deployed = $50,000 tax-free

**2. Tax Bracket Management**
- **Timing:** Reenlist in lower tax bracket year
- **Strategy:** Reenlist early in year if you expect promotion
- **Example:** E-4 → E-5 promotion = higher tax bracket

**3. State Tax Considerations**
- **No State Tax:** Texas, Florida, Washington, Nevada
- **High State Tax:** California, New York, New Jersey
- **Strategy:** Reenlist in no-tax state if possible

---

## The Timing Optimization Strategy

### When to Reenlist for Maximum Benefit

**1. Before Promotion**
- **Why:** Lower tax bracket
- **Example:** E-4 reenlists, then promotes to E-5
- **Benefit:** 15% vs 22% tax bracket

**2. While Deployed (CZTE)**
- **Why:** Tax-free up to $112,000
- **Example:** $50,000 SRB = $50,000 tax-free
- **Benefit:** Save $12,500+ in taxes

**3. Before Anniversary Date**
- **Why:** Lock in current rate
- **Example:** SRB rates change annually
- **Benefit:** Guarantee current rate

**4. After Pay Raise**
- **Why:** Higher base pay = higher SRB
- **Example:** 3.5% pay raise = 3.5% higher SRB
- **Benefit:** Extra $1,000+ in SRB

---

## The Investment Strategy

### What to Do with Your SRB

**1. Emergency Fund First**
- **Target:** 3-6 months expenses
- **Example:** $15,000 emergency fund
- **Benefit:** Financial security

**2. TSP Maximization**
- **Strategy:** Max out TSP for year
- **Example:** $23,000 TSP contribution
- **Benefit:** Tax-deferred growth

**3. Roth TSP Strategy**
- **Why:** Tax-free growth
- **Example:** $23,000 Roth TSP
- **Benefit:** Tax-free retirement income

**4. High-Yield Savings**
- **Target:** 4-5% APY
- **Example:** $20,000 in 5% savings
- **Benefit:** $1,000/year interest

**5. Investment Portfolio**
- **Strategy:** Index funds, ETFs
- **Example:** $30,000 in VTSAX
- **Benefit:** Long-term growth
