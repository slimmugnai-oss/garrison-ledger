# Dual Military Couples: BAH, Co-location, Deployment & Family Planning Complete Guide

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Dual military couples each get full BAH (not split) if married with no kids, $2,500-$6,000/month combined (depending on location). Co-location not guaranteed but can request via MACP (Married Army Couples Program) or branch equivalent. Joint assignments: 60-70% success rate if you apply early. Both deploy = Family Care Plan required (designate guardian for kids). Finances: $120K-$180K combined income (E-5/E-5 to O-3/O-3), saves aggressively, retires at 42-45 with dual pensions ($60K-$90K/year) + $1-2M invested.

## Dual Military BAH (Housing Allowance)

### BAH Rules for Dual Military

**Without kids:**
- ✅ Each gets WITH-dependent BAH rate (higher rate)
- ✅ Combined BAH: $3,000-$6,000/month (depending on location)
- ✅ Live on base: Keep BAH (doesn't get taken)

**With kids:**
- ✅ Each gets WITH-dependent BAH rate
- ✅ Same combined BAH: $3,000-$6,000/month
- ✅ Only need one housing (rent one place, pocket surplus)

### BAH by Rank (Examples - San Diego 2025)

**E-5/E-5 couple:**
- E-5 with deps: $3,243/month each
- Combined: $6,486/month
- Live in $2,500 apartment → **Pocket: $3,986/month**

**E-7/E-6 couple:**
- E-7: $3,726/month
- E-6: $3,243/month
- Combined: $6,969/month

**O-3/O-3 couple:**
- O-3: $3,897/month each
- Combined: $7,794/month
- **Live on $3,000 → Pocket: $4,794/month**

**Result:** Dual military couples have MASSIVE housing allowance surplus (if you live modestly)

## Co-Location (Getting Assigned Together)

### How Co-Location Works by Branch

**Army: MACP (Married Army Couples Program)**
- Enroll in program (both must enroll)
- Request joint assignments during PCS
- Success rate: 60-70% (not guaranteed)
- Same base OR nearby bases (Fort Bragg + Pope AFB)

**Air Force:**
- Join Spouse program
- Request same base during assignment process
- Success rate: 65-75%

**Navy:**
- Co-location via detailer (assignment manager)
- More difficult (ship deployments, sea duty)
- Success rate: 40-50% (lower due to sea duty requirements)

**Marines:**
- Monitor (assignment manager) considers co-location
- Success rate: 50-60%

**Coast Guard:**
- Co-location considered
- Success rate: 60-70%

### When Co-Location Fails

**Separate assignments (common scenarios):**
- Both have critical jobs (can't both leave current units)
- One on sea duty, one on shore duty (Navy)
- One OCONUS, one CONUS (different deployment cycles)
- Operational needs override co-location request

**Options if separated:**
- Geo-bachelor (one stays at assignment, other brings kids)
- Weekend visits (if <4 hour drive)
- Accept separation (short tour = 1 year)
- One person gets out (leave military)

## Deployment Challenges (Dual Military with Kids)

### Family Care Plan (REQUIRED)

**If you have kids, you MUST have Family Care Plan:**
- Designate short-term guardian (deployment <30 days)
- Designate long-term guardian (deployment >30 days)
- Legal documents (power of attorney, guardianship papers)
- Guardian must be willing + able (financially, logistically)

**Common guardians:**
- Grandparents
- Siblings (with stable home)
- Close family friends

**What happens if you don't have one:**
- Can't deploy (career killer)
- Administrative action
- Possible separation from military

### Simultaneous Deployments

**Can both deploy at same time?**
- Technically yes (if Family Care Plan in place)
- Often avoided (one parent defers deployment if possible)

**Reality:**
- Chain of command tries to avoid deploying both parents simultaneously
- But mission needs may require it (especially in high-tempo units)

**If both deploy:**
- Kids live with designated guardian (6-12 months)
- Video calls, emails (like single-parent deployment)
- R&R visits (if aligned)

### Staggered Deployments (Worse?)

**Problem:**
- Parent A deploys: Jan - Jun (6 months)
- Parent A returns, Parent B deploys: Jul - Dec (6 months)
- **Kids have one or both parents gone for 12 months straight**

**Emotionally harder:**
- No "normal" period
- Kids never have both parents home
- Homecoming → immediate deployment (no reintegration time)

**Advocacy:**
- Request deferment if both on deployment cycle
- Talk to command (explain impact on kids)
- Not guaranteed, but worth asking

## Financial Advantages (Dual Military)

### Combined Income (Massive)

**E-5/E-5 couple (typical mid-career):**
- Base pay: $3,000 each = $6,000/month
- BAH: $3,000 each = $6,000/month
- BAS: $450 each = $900/month
- **Total: $12,900/month = $154,800/year**

**O-3/O-3 couple (officers, 6 years):**
- Base pay: $5,500 each = $11,000/month
- BAH: $3,500 each = $7,000/month
- BAS: $300 each = $600/month
- **Total: $18,600/month = $223,200/year**

**Comparison:**
- Dual military E-5/E-5: $154K/year
- Civilian couple (median): $70K-$90K/year
- **Dual military earns 70-100% more**

### Savings Potential (FIRE Path)

**E-5/E-5 couple:**
- Income: $12,900/month
- Live on: $5,000/month (modest)
- Save: $7,900/month = **$94,800/year**

**After 10 years:**
- Saved: $948,000 (at 10% growth)
- Ages: 32-38
- **Can retire early or coast to military retirement**

**At 20 years (retire from military):**
- Dual pensions: $30,000 + $30,000 = $60,000/year (for life)
- Investments: $1.5M - $2M
- **Financially independent at age 42-45**

### Dual TSP (Thrift Savings Plan)

**Each can max TSP:**
- $23,000/year each = $46,000/year combined
- BRS 5% match each = $8,000/year combined
- **Total annual retirement savings: $54,000**

**After 20 years at 10% growth:**
- TSP balance: $2.5M - $3M combined

## Family Planning (Kids + Dual Military)

### Pregnancy & Maternity Leave

**Maternity leave:**
- 12 weeks paid (for birth mother)
- Convalescent leave: 6 weeks (recovery)
- Primary caregiver leave: +6 weeks (total 12 weeks)

**Paternity leave:**
- 12 weeks paid (for non-birth parent)
- Primary caregiver leave (if primary caregiver)
- OR secondary caregiver: 21 days

**Dual military:**
- Birth mother: 12 weeks
- Partner: 12 weeks
- **Can stagger leave = 24 weeks combined** (if command allows)

### Childcare Options

**On-base CDC (Child Development Center):**
- Cost: $150-$600/month (income-based)
- Hours: 6 AM - 6 PM (covers most duty hours)
- Wait list: 6-12 months (sign up EARLY)

**Off-base daycare:**
- Cost: $800-$2,000/month
- More flexible hours (some 24/7 for shift workers)

**Family (grandparents):**
- Free childcare (if nearby)
- Dual military: Often PCS far from family

**Au pair:**
- Live-in caregiver from another country
- Cost: $400-$600/week ($1,600-$2,400/month)
- Covers irregular hours (deployments, TDY)

### Career Impact (Who Stays In?)

**Common decision points:**

**Both stay in (20+ years):**
- ✅ Dual pensions ($60K-$90K/year)
- ✅ Financial independence
- ❌ Hard on kids (moves, deployments)
- ❌ Relationship strain (separations)

**One gets out (spouse stays home):**
- ✅ Stable home for kids
- ✅ One parent always present
- ❌ Lose one income (but still have military pay + BAH)
- ❌ Lose dual pensions (only one retirement)

**Both get out (transition together):**
- ✅ Civilian life, control over location
- ✅ Both pursue careers
- ❌ Lose military benefits (healthcare, pension)
- ❌ Harder transition (both job hunting)

**Decision factors:**
- Kids' ages (young = harder with dual military)
- Career goals (both want to stay in?)
- Deployment tempo (constant separations?)
- Relationship health (surviving dual military stress?)

## Dual Military Relationship Challenges

### Time Apart (Deployments, TDY, Schools)

**Average time apart per year:**
- Deployments: 6-12 months (staggered or simultaneous)
- TDY: 1-3 months
- Schools (PME, training): 1-6 months
- **Total: 8-18 months apart over 2-3 year period**

**Impact:**
- Strain on marriage (communication, intimacy)
- Kids feel abandoned (both parents gone)
- Missed milestones (birthdays, graduations)

**Coping strategies:**
- Video calls (daily if possible)
- Letters, care packages
- Strong Family Care Plan (kids have stability)
- Marriage counseling (Military OneSource = free)

### Career Competition

**Problem:**
- Both want promotion
- Only one can PCS to "good" assignment (career-enhancing)
- One sacrifices career for other

**Example:**
- You: Offered assignment in Hawaii (great for career)
- Spouse: Stuck at current base (no openings in Hawaii)
- Decision: You take Hawaii (geo-bachelor) OR decline (hurt career)

**Solution:**
- Take turns (you sacrifice this PCS, they sacrifice next)
- One person gets out (mutual agreement)
- Both accept that dual military = compromise

### Different Branches (Extra Complexity)

**Army + Air Force:**
- Co-location easier (many joint bases)
- Different cultures (Army = hooah, Air Force = cushier)

**Navy + Marine Corps:**
- Marine often assigned to Navy base (co-location possible)
- Sea duty = separations

**Army + Navy:**
- Very difficult co-location (Army = land bases, Navy = ports)
- Often live apart

## Action Steps

### Before Marriage:
1. ✅ Discuss: How long will both stay in? (20 years? One gets out?)
2. ✅ Research: Co-location programs (MACP, Join Spouse)
3. ✅ Plan: Finances (how to save, investment goals)

### After Marriage:
1. ✅ Enroll in co-location program (MACP, etc.)
2. ✅ Update DEERS (military ID, benefits)
3. ✅ Max TSP (both contribute 5% minimum for BRS match)
4. ✅ Live below BAH (save surplus)

### If Having Kids:
1. ✅ Create Family Care Plan (before pregnancy ends)
2. ✅ Get on CDC wait list (ASAP, 6-12 month wait)
3. ✅ Discuss: Who takes maternity/paternity leave when?

### Every PCS:
1. ✅ Request co-location (doesn't guarantee but helps)
2. ✅ Plan for worst case (geo-bachelor, family stays behind)
3. ✅ Review finances (can you afford dual housing if separated?)

**Remember:** Dual military is HARD (deployments, separations, career conflicts) but LUCRATIVE ($120K-$220K/year, dual pensions, early FIRE). Communicate constantly (about career goals, family, finances), use co-location programs, build strong Family Care Plan, and save aggressively. Thousands of dual military couples make it work - you can too.
