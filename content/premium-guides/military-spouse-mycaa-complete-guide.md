# Military Spouse MyCAA: Get $4,000 for Career Training (Complete Guide)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** MyCAA gives eligible military spouses up to $4,000 for education/certifications in portable careers. It's FREE money, but has strict eligibility rules and must be used for approved programs. Most spouses who qualify are leaving this benefit unused.

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### ❌ Mistake #1: Waiting Too Long
**Reality:** Spouse gets promoted to E-6 → you lose eligibility FOREVER, even if halfway through program.

**Fix:** Use MyCAA as soon as you're eligible. Don't wait.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Choosing Non-Portable Career
**Reality:** You pick a state-specific certification → MyCAA denies funding.

**Fix:** Stick to the approved portable careers list on MyCAA.mil.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Enrolling in Non-Approved School
**Reality:** School not in MyCAA database → you pay out of pocket.

**Fix:** Search MyCAA's approved school list FIRST, then enroll.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Using Full $4,000
**Reality:** You use $1,500 → spouse promotes → you lose remaining $2,500 benefit.

**Fix:** Plan a program that uses the full $4,000 (or as close as possible).

### ❌ Mistake #5: Forgetting to Recertify Annually
**Reality:** Your account expires → you have to reapply and may lose funding.

**Fix:** Log into MyCAA.mil at least once per year to keep account active.
