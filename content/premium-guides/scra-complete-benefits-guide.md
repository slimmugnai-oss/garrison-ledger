# SCRA: The Complete Guide to Servicemembers Civil Relief Act Benefits

**Bottom Line Up Front:** SCRA caps interest rates at 6% on debts incurred BEFORE active duty, protects you from eviction and foreclosure, and pauses legal proceedings while you serve. Most service members are leaving $2,000-$5,000 per year on the table by not using these benefits.

## What Is SCRA?

### The Law
The **Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)** is a federal law that provides financial and legal protections to active duty service members (and some reservists/Guard on active duty orders).

### Who It Covers
- ✅ Active duty military (all branches, including Space Force)
- ✅ Activated National Guard/Reserves (Title 10 orders)
- ✅ Officers on active duty (including ROTC awaiting orders)
- ✅ Commissioned officers of Public Health Service/NOAA

### Who It Does NOT Cover
- ❌ Reserve/Guard NOT on active duty orders
- ❌ Veterans (protections end when you ETS/retire)
- ❌ Dependents (in most cases — some states extend benefits)

### Critical Timing Rule
**SCRA benefits apply to debts incurred BEFORE entering active duty.**

Example:
- You have a credit card with 18% APR from college
- You join the military
- **SCRA caps that card at 6% retroactive to your active duty start date**

---

## 6% Interest Rate Cap (The Big One)

### What It Covers
Any debt obligation incurred BEFORE active duty:
- ✅ Credit cards
- ✅ Mortgages
- ✅ Auto loans
- ✅ Student loans
- ✅ Personal loans
- ✅ Medical debt

### What It Does NOT Cover
- ❌ Debts incurred AFTER entering active duty
- ❌ Voluntary debts (e.g., you take out a new loan while active duty)

### The Math: How Much Money This Saves

**Example 1: Credit Card Debt**
- Balance: $10,000
- Original APR: 18%
- SCRA APR: 6%
- **Annual savings: $1,200**

**Example 2: Mortgage**
- Balance: $300,000
- Original APR: 7.5%
- SCRA APR: 6%
- **Annual savings: $4,500**
- **Total savings over 5 years: $22,500!**

**Example 3: Auto Loan**
- Balance: $25,000
- Original APR: 9%
- SCRA APR: 6%
- **Annual savings: $750**

### How to Apply

**Step 1: Identify Eligible Debts**
- Pull your credit report (AnnualCreditReport.com)
- List all debts from BEFORE active duty
- Note the current interest rates

**Step 2: Gather Documentation**
- Active duty orders (DA Form 2A or equivalent)
- LES showing active duty status
- Copy of your military ID (both sides)

**Step 3: Contact Each Creditor**
- Call the customer service number
- Say: "I am requesting SCRA interest rate relief under 50 USC § 3937"
- Email/fax your orders + written request
- Request written confirmation of new 6% rate

**Step 4: Verify the Rate Change**
- Check next month's statement
- Confirm interest charge matches 6% APR
- Request refund of excess interest already paid

## Housing Protections

### Lease Termination Rights

**Who qualifies:**
- PCS orders to a location 35+ miles from current residence
- Deployment orders for 90+ days
- Separation/ETS from military

**How it works:**
1. Provide landlord written notice + copy of orders
2. Termination effective 30 days after next rent payment due
3. No early termination fees
4. Get security deposit back (minus legitimate damages)

**Example:**
- You receive PCS orders on March 15
- Your lease doesn't end until December 31
- Provide notice + orders → lease terminates April 30
- **Savings: $8,000+ in rent + no early termination penalty**

### Eviction Protection

**What it does:**
- Delays eviction proceedings while you're on active duty
- Landlord must get court approval before evicting
- Protects you from eviction due to nonpayment if caused by military service

**Limit:** Only applies to leases $4,269.38/month or less (2025 limit, adjusted annually)

### Foreclosure Protection

**What it does:**
- Lender must get court order before foreclosing
- Judge can delay foreclosure up to 9 months

## Legal Protections

### Stay of Proceedings

2. Appointing an attorney to represent you
3. Determining your military service didn't affect your ability to respond

## Tax Benefits

### State Income Tax Exemption

**Military Spouse Residency Relief Act (MSRRA):**

## Common Denials & How to Fight Them

### Denial #1: "This debt was incurred after you joined"

**How to fight:**
- Provide proof of debt origination date
- Student loans from college? Provide enrollment dates
- Credit card opened in high school? Provide statements

### Denial #2: "SCRA doesn't apply to [X type of debt]"

**How to fight:**
- Cite 50 USC § 3937 (covers ALL debts at 6%)
- Escalate to SCRA compliance department
- File complaint with CFPB (ConsumerFinance.gov)

### Denial #3: "You need to prove financial hardship"

**How to fight:**
- This is FALSE. SCRA doesn't require hardship.
- The law states interest cap applies regardless of ability to pay
- Cite the statute directly

### Denial #4: "We already gave you a military discount"

**How to fight:**
- SCRA is not a "discount" — it's federal law
- The 6% cap is mandatory
- A "military rate" of 8% is still illegal if debt was pre-service
