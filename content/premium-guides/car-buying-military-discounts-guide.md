# Car Buying for Military: Discounts, Financing & Avoiding Dealer Scams

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Military car discounts: $500-$750 from major manufacturers (Ford, Chevy, Toyota, Honda). NEVER finance at dealership (18-25% APR for E-4 and below). Use USAA/Navy Federal/PenFed car loans (2.5-4.5% APR). Avoid dealer scams: unnecessary warranties ($2,000-$5,000), overpriced add-ons (nitrogen tires, paint protection), monthly payment focus (hides inflated price). Buy used 2-3 year old car, save $10,000-$20,000 in depreciation.

**Not worth chasing:**
- ❌ Buying used (no manufacturer rebates on used)

## Dealer Scams Targeting Military (AVOID)

### Scam #1: "Monthly Payment Focus"

**How it works:**
- You: "I want to spend $25,000"
- Dealer: "What monthly payment works for you?"
- You: "$400/month"
- Dealer: "Great! I can get you into this $30,000 car for $400/month!"
- **Hidden:** 84-month loan at 12% APR (you pay $33,600 total for $30K car)

**Fix:**
- Negotiate on TOTAL PRICE, not monthly payment
- Keep loan term to 48-60 months maximum
- Calculate payment yourself: Use auto loan calculator

### Scam #2: Unnecessary Warranties & Add-Ons

**Common add-ons (total scam):**
- Extended warranty: $2,000-$4,000 (rarely used, dealership profit)
- Gap insurance: $800-$1,200 (get from USAA for $50-$100)
- Paint protection: $500-$1,200 (just wax your car)
- Nitrogen-filled tires: $200 (regular air is 78% nitrogen anyway)
- VIN etching: $300 (takes 5 minutes, costs $15)
- Fabric protection: $400 (Scotchgard at Walmart = $10)

**Total scam add-ons: $4,000-$7,000!**

**Fix:** Say "No" to ALL add-ons. Buy gap insurance from USAA if needed.

### Scam #3: The "Four-Square" Trick

**How it works:**
- Dealer draws square with 4 boxes: Car price, Trade-in, Down payment, Monthly payment
- Manipulates all 4 to confuse you
- Gives good deal on one, rips you off on others

**Example:**
- Shows low monthly payment ($350) ✅
- But lowballs trade-in ($3,000 for car worth $6,000) ❌
- And inflates car price ($28,000 for car worth $25,000) ❌

**Fix:**
- Negotiate car price FIRST (finalize)
- Negotiate trade-in separately (or sell privately)
- Secure financing BEFORE visiting dealer

### Scam #4: Spot Delivery / Yo-Yo Financing

**How it works:**
1. You "buy" car, drive home
2. Dealer calls 3 days later: "Financing fell through, come back"
3. You return, dealer offers worse terms (higher rate)
4. You're emotionally attached to car, accept bad deal

**Fix:**
- Get pre-approved loan from Navy Federal BEFORE shopping
- Tell dealer: "I have my own financing"
- If they offer better rate, verify IN WRITING before signing

### Scam #5: Targeting Junior Enlisted

**Reality:**
- Base dealerships near every installation
- Specialize in high-interest loans to E-4 and below
- "Everyone gets approved!" (yes, at 22% APR)

**Example:**
- E-3 buys $35,000 Mustang
- 22% APR, 84-month loan
- Monthly payment: $747
- Total paid: $62,748
- **Lost to interest: $27,748!**

**Fix:** Don't buy NEW expensive car as junior enlisted. Buy used, modest car until E-5+.
