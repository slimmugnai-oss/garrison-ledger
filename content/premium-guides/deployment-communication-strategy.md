# Deployment Communication Strategy: Staying Connected When You're 7,000 Miles Apart

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Successful deployment communication requires scheduled video calls, asynchronous messaging for time zones, shared apps for daily connection, and realistic expectations. Most relationship strain during deployment comes from poor communication planning, not distance itself.

## The Deployment Communication Reality Check

### What Hollywood Gets Wrong
- ❌ Daily 2-hour video calls
- ❌ Perfect signal quality
- ❌ Always being "available"

### What Actually Works
- ✅ Scheduled calls (both partners know when to expect them)
- ✅ Asynchronous messaging (texts, emails that don't need immediate response)
- ✅ Shared daily routines (even from 7,000 miles away)
- ✅ Patience with connectivity issues

---

## Communication Schedule Framework

### Weekly Structure (Example)

**Priority #1: Scheduled Video Calls**
- **When:** Sunday 0900 (deployed) / Saturday 1900 (home)
- **Duration:** 45-60 minutes
- **Platform:** WhatsApp, FaceTime (if bandwidth allows), or Facebook Messenger
- **Backup:** If connection fails, switch to voice call

**Priority #2: Daily Check-Ins**
- **When:** Morning and evening
- **Method:** Text or voice message
- **Content:** "Good morning, love you" or "How was your day?"
- **Time:** 2-5 minutes

**Priority #3: Weekly Letter/Email**
- **When:** Monday (write about previous week)
- **Why:** Deeper thoughts that don't fit in quick calls
- **Format:** Email, old-fashioned letter, or shared journal

## Communication Do's and Don'ts

### DO:

**✅ Set Realistic Expectations**
- Agree on call frequency BEFORE deployment
- Understand connectivity will be unreliable
- Plan for missed calls

**✅ Use Time Zone Converter**
- Set alarms for call times

- Save heavy conversations for video calls (not texts)

**✅ Have "Date Nights"**

- Pretend you're together

### DON'T:

- They're working 12-16 hour shifts
- WiFi might be down for days
- Missions take priority

**❌ Overshare Bad News via Text**
- "The car broke down, the dog is sick, and I'm overwhelmed"

## Handling Communication Breakdowns

### Scenario 1: "They Haven't Called in a Week"

**Why it happens:**
- OPSEC (Operational Security) blackout
- Missions in progress
- Connectivity lost

**What to do:**
- Don't panic
- Check FRG (Family Readiness Group) for updates
- Trust no news is good news
- Continue sending messages (they'll see them later)

### Scenario 2: "Every Call Turns Into an Argument"

**Why it happens:**
- Stress on both sides
- Time zones make both partners tired
- Lack of physical presence for conflict resolution

**What to do:**
- Set a "cooling off" rule (end call if heated, revisit next day)
- Focus on positive topics first
- Save tough conversations for when you're NOT exhausted

### Scenario 3: "We Have Nothing to Talk About"

**Why it happens:**
- Daily routines become boring
- Fear of oversharing mundane details

**What to do:**
- Use conversation starters ("Rose/Thorn/Bud" - best part of day, worst part, looking forward to)
- Share photos and ask about them
- Play games together (online chess, Words With Friends, etc.)
- Watch same shows and discuss

**Remember:** Deployment is temporary. Bad communication habits last forever. The couples who thrive during deployment are the ones who plan, adjust expectations, and prioritize connection over perfection.
