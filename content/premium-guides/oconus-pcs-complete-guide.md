# OCONUS PCS Complete Guide: Europe, Asia, & Pacific Assignments (2025)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** OCONUS (Outside Continental US) PCS comes with extra allowances (COLA, OHA, move-in housing), command-sponsored vs. unaccompanied choice, and unique challenges (passports, customs, POV shipping). Plan 6-9 months ahead for pets, schooling, and vehicle logistics. Most service members underestimate the upfront costs ($5,000-$10,000) before reimbursements arrive.

## OCONUS Basics

### What Is OCONUS?
**Outside Continental United States** — assignments in:
- Europe (Germany, Italy, UK, Spain, Belgium)
- Pacific (Japan, South Korea, Guam, Hawaii*)
- Middle East (Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Diego Garcia)
- Other (Alaska*, Greenland, Iceland)

_*Alaska and Hawaii are "non-foreign OCONUS" (different rules than overseas)_

### Two Assignment Types

**1. Command-Sponsored (Accompanied Tour)**
- Bring dependents
- Full housing & allowances
- Longer tour (usually 3 years)
- Spouses/kids get ID cards & base privileges

**2. Unaccompanied (Short Tour)**
- No dependents authorized
- Higher pay (family separation, hardship)
- Shorter tour (1-2 years)
- Family stays in US (you pay for two households)

---

## OCONUS Allowances (The Money Part)

### 1. Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA)
**Replaces BAH when stationed OCONUS**

**How it works:**
- Pays ACTUAL rent (up to cap) + utilities
- Submit rental receipt monthly
- Get reimbursed up to local cap

**Example: Germany (Ramstein AB)**
- Rental cap: €2,100/month (~$2,300)
- Utilities: €250/month (~$275)
- Total OHA: ~$2,575/month

**OHA vs. BAH differences:**
- OHA = actual rent (can't pocket difference)
- BAH = fixed rate (pocket difference if rent is lower)
- OHA includes utilities allowance (BAH doesn't)

### 2. Cost of Living Allowance (COLA)
**Offsets higher cost of living overseas**

**How much:**
- Varies by location: 5% to 35% of base pay
- Adjusted quarterly based on currency exchange

**Example: Japan (Okinawa) for E-5 with dependents**
- Base pay: $3,500/month
- COLA: 15% = $525/month
- **Extra $6,300/year**

### 3. Move-In Housing Allowance (MIHA)
**One-time payment for furniture, appliances, deposits**

**Typical amounts:**
- $1,500-$3,000 depending on rank and location
- Covers rental deposits, basic furniture
- Must submit receipts

## Common OCONUS Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Saving Upfront Cash
**Reality:** OHA reimbursement takes 30-60 days. You pay rent out-of-pocket first.

**Fix:** Save $5,000-$10,000 for first month's rent, deposit, furniture.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Shipping Gas-Guzzler to Europe
**Reality:** Gas is $7-9/gallon. Your F-150 costs $200/month in gas.

**Fix:** Buy fuel-efficient car locally or ship a hybrid.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Researching Pet Import Rules
**Reality:** Your dog gets quarantined for 6 months because you missed the blood test.

**Fix:** Start pet prep 6-9 months before PCS.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Expecting BAH-Like OHA
**Reality:** OHA pays actual rent. If you live cheap, you don't pocket the difference.

**Fix:** Budget based on OHA reimbursing exact rent, not BAH strategy.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Joining OCONUS-Specific Facebook Groups
**Reality:** You miss insider tips on housing, schools, POV buying.

**Fix:** Join "[Base Name] Newcomers" Facebook groups 6 months before PCS.
