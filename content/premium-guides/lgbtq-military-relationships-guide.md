# LGBTQ+ Relationships in Military: Rights, Benefits & Navigating Military Culture

**Bottom Line Up Front:** LGBTQ+ service members have full legal rights since DOMA repeal (2013) and Don't Ask Don't Tell end (2011). Same benefits as heterosexual couples: BAH, TRICARE, ID cards, base housing. Challenges: Conservative military culture (varies by unit), state-to-state PCS (legal protections vary), finding community (LGBTQ+ veterans groups). Legal protections: Equal treatment required, discrimination complaints through EO (Equal Opportunity), federal marriage recognition regardless of state. Resources: SPARTA (LGBTQ+ military organization), OutServe-SLDN, GLAD Military Project (legal help), base EO office. Thousands of LGBTQ+ service members serve openly - you're not alone.

## Legal Rights (Full Equality Since 2013)

### Marriage Benefits (All Couples)

**Same-sex married couples get:**
- ✅ BAH with-dependent rate (same as opposite-sex)
- ✅ TRICARE for spouse (full coverage)
- ✅ Base housing (family housing)
- ✅ Dependent ID card (base access, commissary)
- ✅ SBP (Survivor Benefit Plan - spouse gets pension if you die)
- ✅ SGLI beneficiary ($500K life insurance)

**No difference:** Same benefits, same process

**Applies regardless of state:**
- Federal benefits (BAH, TRICARE) apply even in states that don't recognize same-sex marriage
- Federal law overrides state law for military

### Don't Ask Don't Tell (DADT) Ended 2011

**Before 2011:**
- Closeted service (couldn't be openly LGBTQ+)
- Discharged if discovered

**After 2011:**
- Can serve openly
- Protected from discrimination
- Can marry, bring spouse to military events, live openly

**Impact:**
- 14,000+ discharged under DADT (1994-2011)
- Many now eligible for VA benefits (discharge characterization upgrades available)

## Military Culture & Coming Out

### Culture Varies by Unit/Branch

**More accepting:**
- Large bases (Fort Bragg, Fort Hood, Camp Pendleton)
- Urban areas (bases near cities)
- Support/admin jobs (medical, intel, logistics)
- Some branches perceived as more accepting (Air Force, Coast Guard)

**Less accepting:**
- Small remote bases
- Combat arms (infantry, special ops - though changing)
- Conservative leadership
- Rural locations

**Reality:**
- Depends more on unit leadership than branch/location
- Supportive commander = supportive unit
- Toxic commander = toxic culture

### To Come Out or Not?

**Factors to consider:**
- Unit culture (progressive or conservative?)
- Your comfort level (are you ready?)
- Career impact (seeking promotion? deployment coming?)
- Support network (friends in unit you trust?)

**Options:**
- Fully out (open with everyone)
- Selectively out (close friends know, leadership doesn't)
- Closeted (not ready to share)

**All valid choices:** Your personal decision, your timeline

### If You Come Out

**Protections:**
- Discrimination = illegal (Equal Opportunity violation)
- Harassment = reportable (EO complaint)
- Retaliation = prohibited (file IG complaint)

**Reality:**
- Some units: Fully accepting, no issues
- Other units: Microaggressions, subtle hostility
- Rare but possible: Overt discrimination (report to EO immediately)

**Support:**
- Find LGBTQ+ allies in unit (they exist, even if quiet)
- Connect with SPARTA (LGBTQ+ military organization)
- Base EO office (report discrimination)

## Relationships & Benefits

### Same-Sex Marriage & BAH

**How it works:**
- Married = with-dependent BAH (regardless of gender)
- Same process as opposite-sex couples

**Updating DEERS:**
- Bring marriage certificate to ID card office
- Enroll spouse in DEERS (within 30 days)
- Spouse gets dependent ID

**BAH adjustment:**
- Automatically updated to with-dependent rate (once spouse in DEERS)
- Effective date: Date of marriage

**No different than opposite-sex couples**

### Adoption & Parental Leave

**Second-parent adoption:**
- One partner biological parent (via surrogacy, previous relationship)
- Other partner adopts child (legal parentage)

**Parental leave:**
- Birth parent: 12 weeks (primary caregiver leave)
- Non-birth parent: 12 weeks (primary or secondary caregiver)
- Adoption: 12 weeks for both parents (if primary caregiver)

**Same as opposite-sex couples**

## Challenges Specific to LGBTQ+ Military

### PCS to Conservative States

**Concern:**
- PCS from California (liberal) to Texas (conservative)
- State has fewer LGBTQ+ protections
- Hostile local culture off-base

**Reality:**
- Federal military benefits protected (can't be taken by state)
- But: Local discrimination possible (housing, schools, community)

**Mitigation:**
- Research area LGBTQ+ friendliness (Human Rights Campaign state scorecards)
- Find LGBTQ+ community (meetup groups, pride centers)
- Live on-base if off-base feels unsafe (base housing = federal protections)

### Don't Ask Don't Tell Discharge Upgrades

**If discharged under DADT (before 2011):**
- May be eligible for discharge characterization upgrade
- Upgrade: Other Than Honorable → Honorable
- Unlocks: VA benefits, GI Bill, VA home loans

**How to apply:**
- Discharge Review Board (each branch has own)
- Submit: Application, service records, statement explaining DADT discharge
- DADT upgrade requests = high approval rate (80%+)

**Timeline:** 6-12 months for decision

### Transgender Service Members

**Policy (as of 2025):**
- Policies have fluctuated (Trump admin banned 2017, Biden reversed 2021)
- Current: Transgender service members CAN serve openly
- Medical transition: Covered by TRICARE (case-by-case)

**Challenges:**
- Policy instability (changes with administration)
- Some units more accepting than others
- Medical treatment access varies

**Resources:**
- SPARTA (advocacy)
- GLAD Military Project (legal help)
- Modern Military Association of America (MMAA)

## Finding LGBTQ+ Community (Military)

### On-Base Resources

**Equal Opportunity (EO) Office:**
- Reports discrimination
- LGBTQ+ awareness training
- Can connect you to resources

**Base chapel:**
- Some bases have inclusive chaplains
- Not all chaplains are accepting (find the right one)

**MWR events:**
- Pride month events (June - some bases celebrate)

### Off-Base Community

**Local LGBTQ+ centers:**
- Pride centers, meetup groups
- Google "[City] LGBT center"

**Military-specific:**
- **SPARTA:** LGBTQ+ military organization, chapters nationwide
- **OutServe-SLDN:** Veteran-focused
- **American Military Partner Association (AMPA):** For LGBTQ+ military families

**Online:**
- Facebook groups ([Base Name] LGBT)
- Reddit: r/MilitaryLGBT
- Instagram: #LGBTQMilitary

## Deployment & LGBTQ+ Relationships

### Unique Concerns

**If not out:**
- Deployment communication = hard (can't talk openly about partner)
- Letters censored (if you mention relationship)

**If out:**
- Most deployment communication = fine
- Care packages: Include partner's letters/photos (same as straight couples)
- Video calls: Same access

**Homecoming:**
- Public displays of affection (kissing at homecoming) = your choice
- Some couples: Public, others: Private (comfort level varies)

### Unit Support (Or Lack Thereof)

**Best case:**
- Unit fully supportive
- Partner invited to unit events
- Treated same as opposite-sex couples

**Worst case:**
- Excluded from social events
- Microaggressions, comments
- Partner not welcomed

**Your options:**
- Report (EO complaint)
- Find different social circle (outside unit)
- Request transfer (if toxic environment)

## Marriage Preparation (Legal Considerations)

### Where to Marry

**All states recognize same-sex marriage** (federal law since 2015)

**But:**
- Some states have "religious freedom" laws (vendors can refuse service)
- Conservative states = harder to find wedding vendors

**Recommendation:**
- Marry in LGBTQ-friendly state OR on base (base chapel, if accepting chaplain available)

### Pre-Marriage Financial Planning

**Same considerations as opposite-sex couples:**
- Finances (combine or separate accounts?)
- Career (both staying in military? One getting out?)
- Kids (adoption? Surrogacy? Timeline?)

**Unique:**
- Legal parentage (second-parent adoption if one is biological parent)
- Surrogacy costs ($100K-$150K if using - plan financially)
