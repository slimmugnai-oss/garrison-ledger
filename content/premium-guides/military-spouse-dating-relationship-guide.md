# Dating in the Military: Building Relationships as Active Duty or Military Spouse

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Military dating challenges: Deployments (6-12 months apart), frequent PCS (moving every 2-3 years disrupts relationships), demanding schedules (12+ hour days, shift work), career conflicts (dual military couples face assignment conflicts). Successful military relationships require: Clear communication about military lifestyle, flexibility with schedule changes, independence (spouse needs own life/hobbies during separations), trust (foundation for long-distance periods). Dating timeline: 6-12 months before considering marriage (understand military life first). Red flags: Gold diggers (only interested in benefits), stage 5 clingers (can't handle independence), military-only daters (fetishize uniform). Marriage benefits: BAH, TRICARE, commissary access - but marry for love, not benefits.

## Military Dating Reality Check

### What Makes Military Dating Different

**Time apart:**
- Deployments: 6-12 months (sometimes longer)
- TDY: 1-6 months
- Training: Weeks to months
- Field exercises: Days to weeks
- **Result:** Significant time apart (30-50% of year for some jobs)

**Unpredictable schedule:**
- "I'll be home at 5 PM" → Gets home at 9 PM (last-minute tasking)
- Date night planned → Cancelled (duty, recall, emergency)
- Weekend plans → Cancelled (deployment moved up)

**Frequent moves:**
- PCS every 2-3 years
- Long-distance becomes necessity (if partner can't/won't move)
- Starting over socially every move

**Stress:**
- Combat deployments (life-threatening)
- High-stakes jobs (lives depend on them)
- Toxic leadership (bad commanders)
- PTSD, injuries, mental health challenges

**Career conflicts (especially dual military):**
- Assignment preferences conflict
- Promotions require PCS (relationship vs. career)
- One person's career suffers for other's

## Dating Timeline (Military-Specific)

### Stage 1: Initial Dating (0-3 Months)

**What you're learning:**
- Are we compatible?
- Do they understand military lifestyle?
- Can they handle my schedule?

**Red flags at this stage:**
- Complains about every schedule change ("You're always working!")
- Jealous of military (sees military as competition)
- Rushes to marriage ("Let's get married so I can get benefits!")

**Green flags:**
- Flexible ("I understand your schedule changes")
- Independent (has own hobbies, friends, life)
- Asks questions about military life (genuine interest, not just benefits)

### Stage 2: Serious Dating (3-12 Months)

**What you're testing:**
- Can they handle deployment/TDY?
- Do they support my career?
- Are we ready for marriage?

**Key experiences:**
- First TDY/deployment separation (how do they handle it?)
- First PCS conversation (are they willing to move?)
- Meeting families (do families support relationship?)

**Before proposing:**
- Experience at least ONE significant separation (TDY, deployment, training)
- Discuss: Marriage timeline, career goals, kids, where to live
- Ensure they understand: Deployments, PCS, military lifestyle demands

**Don't rush:** Many military members marry too fast (meet, marry within 6 months). Higher divorce rate (military divorce rate ~3% per year vs. 2% civilian).

### Stage 3: Engagement (Pre-Marriage)

**Critical conversations:**
- Will you move with me every PCS? (or stay put?)
- Career: Will you work? What happens when we PCS?
- Kids: When? How many?
- Finances: Combine or separate? Who manages money?
- Family: How often visit? Who takes priority (my family vs. yours)?

**Premarital counseling:**
- Free through base chapel
- Addresses military-specific issues (deployment, PCS, finances)
- **Highly recommended** (couples who do premarital counseling = lower divorce rate)

## Where to Meet People (Military Dating)

### On-Base Options

**Pros:**
- ✅ Everyone understands military lifestyle
- ✅ Shared experiences (all dealing with deployments, PCS)
- ✅ Easy to meet (MWR events, gym, commissary)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Limited dating pool (especially small bases)
- ❌ Everyone knows your business (barracks gossip)
- ❌ Fraternization issues (officer/enlisted can't date)

**Where to meet:**
- MWR events (movie nights, trips, classes)
- Base gym (common meeting spot)
- Volunteer activities (Airman's Attic, base events)
- Unit social events (if appropriate rank)

### Off-Base Options

**Pros:**
- ✅ Larger dating pool
- ✅ Date civilians (different perspective)
- ✅ Privacy (less barracks gossip)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Explaining military lifestyle (they may not understand)
- ❌ Harder to relate (they don't get deployment stress)

**Where to meet:**
- Hobbies/interests (running clubs, CrossFit, book clubs)
- Online dating (Hinge, Bumble, Match)
- Local events (concerts, festivals, community activities)
- Through friends (best for vetted introductions)

### Online Dating (Military-Specific Tips)

**Profile honesty:**
- ✅ Mention you're military (upfront about lifestyle)
- ✅ Be clear about deployment schedule ("I deploy in 3 months")
- ✅ Show personality (not just uniform photos)

**Safety:**
- ❌ Don't post base name publicly (OPSEC)
- ❌ Don't overshare deployment dates (security risk)
- ✅ Meet in public first time (standard dating safety)

**Red flags in messages:**
- Immediately asks about benefits ("Do you get BAH?")
- Only interested in military status (fetishizes uniform)
- Rushing ("Let's get married, I'll move to your base!")

## Red Flags (Who to Avoid)

### Gold Diggers (Only Want Benefits)

**Warning signs:**
- Asks about BAH, TRICARE before asking about YOU
- Rushes to marriage ("Let's get married next month!")
- Unemployed, no career plans ("I'll just be a military spouse")
- Previous relationships were also military

**Reality:**
- Military benefits are good (BAH, TRICARE, commissary)
- But not worth marrying someone who doesn't love you

**Example benefits (E-5 with dependents):**
- BAH: $2,000-$3,000/month (vs. single BAH ~$1,500)
- TRICARE: Free healthcare (vs. $400/month civilian insurance)
- **Total value: $500-$1,900/month** ($6,000-$22,800/year)

**Don't marry for benefits:** Divorce is expensive + emotionally devastating

### Stage 5 Clingers (Can't Handle Independence)

**Warning signs:**
- Constant texting (expects immediate responses)
- Can't be alone (no hobbies, no friends outside relationship)
- Jealous of military ("You love the military more than me!")
- Emotional breakdown every TDY ("I can't survive without you")

**Reality:**
- Military requires independence (deployments, TDY, long hours)
- If they can't handle 2-week TDY, they can't handle 9-month deployment

**Fix:**
- Early in relationship: Test with shorter separations
- If they can't handle it: Better to know now than after marriage

### Military-Only Daters (Uniform Fetish)

**Warning signs:**
- Only dates military
- Only attracted when in uniform
- Treats military status as identity ("I'm an Army girlfriend!")
- Knows ranks, acronyms, regulations better than you

**Concern:**
- May be more in love with military lifestyle than with YOU

## Dual Military Relationships

### Unique Challenges

**Assignment conflicts:**
- You get orders to Alaska
- Partner gets orders to Texas
- Choose: Relationship (decline orders, risk career) OR Career (accept orders, long-distance)

**Co-location success rate:** 60-70% (not guaranteed)

**Deployment:**
- Both deploy = who takes care of kids? (need Family Care Plan)
- Staggered deployments = kids have one parent gone for 18 months straight

**Career competition:**
- Both want promotion → only one can PCS to "good" assignment
- Resentment if one's career suffers

### Benefits

**Financial:**
- Dual BAH ($4,000-$6,000/month combined)
- Dual income ($120K-$200K/year combined)
- Retire at 42 with dual pensions

**Understanding:**
- Both understand military lifestyle (deployments, schedule, stress)
- Shared experiences

**How to make it work:**
- Use co-location programs (MACP for Army, Join Spouse for Air Force)
- Apply for assignments together
- Be flexible (one person's career may take priority temporarily, alternate)

---

## Long-Distance Military Relationships

### When Long-Distance Happens

**Scenarios:**
- Partner can't/won't PCS with you
- Dating before PCS, relationship too new to make decision
- Deployment (6-12 months apart)
- Dual military with separate assignments

### Making Long-Distance Work

**Communication:**
- Daily check-ins (text, video call)
- Set expectations ("I'll call every Sunday at 7 PM")
- Quality > quantity (30-min meaningful call > 5 hrs of texting)

**Visits:**
- Every 1-3 months if possible (budget permitting)
- Alternate who travels
- Make visits special (not just sitting on couch)

**End goal:**
- Long-distance is temporary (plan to reunite)
- "One more PCS and we'll be together" (gives hope)
- If indefinite long-distance → relationship unlikely to survive

**Success rate:** 30-40% of military long-distance relationships survive to reuniting

### Benefits of Military Marriage
