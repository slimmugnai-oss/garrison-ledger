## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Staying in Location-Dependent Career
**Reality:** You PCS every 2-3 years. State-specific license doesn't transfer. You're unemployed again.

**Fix:** Choose portable careers (remote work, federal jobs, nursing with NLC, etc.)

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Using MyCAA Before Spouse Promotes
**Reality:** Spouse gets promoted to E-6. You lose $4,000 benefit forever.

**Fix:** Use MyCAA EARLY (when spouse is E-1 to E-5). Don't wait.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Applying for Federal Jobs (MSP)
**Reality:** You don't know about Military Spouse Preference. You miss out on priority hiring.

**Fix:** Create USAJobs.gov account. Apply to federal jobs. Use MSP.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Giving Up After One PCS Derails Career
**Reality:** You lose job due to PCS. You give up. Years go by. Career gap widens.

**Fix:** Pivot to remote/portable career. Each PCS is a chance to restart smarter.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Networking with Other Mil Spouses
**Reality:** You try to figure everything out alone. Miss job referrals, tips, support.

**Fix:** Join military spouse Facebook groups, attend spouse events, use Military OneSource.
