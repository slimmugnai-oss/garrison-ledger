# BAH Fraud: What NOT to Do (And the Consequences)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** BAH fraud = lying about dependents, living arrangements, or marital status to get higher BAH. Consequences: Court-martial, repay ALL fraudulent BAH (often $30,000-$100,000+), dishonorable discharge, federal prison (up to 5 years), loss of all VA benefits. Not worth it. If you make honest mistake, self-report immediately.

## What Counts as BAH Fraud

### Common BAH Fraud Schemes (All Illegal)

**1. Fake Marriage for BAH**
- Marry someone to get BAH with-dependents rate
- No actual relationship
- Sometimes called "contract marriage"
- **Penalty:** Court-martial, repay BAH, dishonorable discharge, possible federal charges

**Example:**
- E-3 marries friend to get BAH increase
- Gets $800/month more BAH ($9,600/year)
- Caught after 3 years
- Must repay: $28,800
- Court-martial: Reduction to E-1, 60 days confinement, bad conduct discharge

**2. Not Reporting Divorce**
- Get divorced but don't update DEERS
- Continue receiving BAH with-dependents
- Pocket extra $400-$800/month
- **Penalty:** Same as above (fraud)

**Example:**
- E-6 divorces in January
- Doesn't update DEERS for 18 months
- Receives $600/month excess BAH ($10,800 total)
- Finance catches it during audit
- Charged with fraud, must repay + court-martial

**3. Fake Dependents**
- Claim child that's not yours
- Claim custody of child you don't actually have
- **Penalty:** Federal fraud charges + military justice

**4. False Living Arrangements**
- Claim you're living off-base (receiving BAH)
- Actually living in barracks rent-free
- Pocket entire BAH
- **Penalty:** Court-martial, repayment, discharge

**5. Fake Separation for Dual-Military BAH**
- Dual-military couple pretends to separate
- Both claim BAH as "single with dependents"
- Actually living together
- **Penalty:** Both court-martialed, both must repay

## How BAH Fraud Gets Caught

### Audit Triggers
1. **Random DEERS audits:** Finance randomly checks DEERS vs. reality
2. **Anonymous tips:** Jealous co-workers, ex-spouses, neighbors
3. **Divorce filings:** Court notifies military of divorce
4. **PCS audits:** Housing office cross-checks with finance
5. **Social media:** Posts about "roommate" when claiming single-with-dependents

### Investigation Process
1. Finance flags discrepancy
2. Commander opens investigation
3. CID/NCIS/OSI interviews you
4. DEERS records pulled
5. Marriage certificates, divorce decrees, custody agreements verified
6. If fraud confirmed → court-martial charges

## Honest Mistakes vs. Fraud

### Honest Mistakes (Usually Not Prosecuted)

**Scenario 1: Delayed DEERS Update**
- You get divorced in December
- Plan to update DEERS in January
- Finance processes divorce before you update
- Receive 1 extra month of "with dependents" BAH

**What to do:**
- Self-report immediately
- Repay excess BAH
- Provide proof you planned to update
- Usually: Counseling, no court-martial

**Scenario 2: Custody Change**
- You had custody, got "with dependents" BAH
- Ex gets custody back
- You forget to update (honest mistake)

**What to do:**
- Report as soon as you realize
- Repay from date custody changed
- Show good faith (no intent to defraud)

### Fraud (Prosecuted Aggressively)

**Intent to deceive = Fraud**
- Deliberately not reporting divorce
- Fake marriage
- Lying on DEERS forms
- Collecting excess BAH knowing you're not entitled

## Self-Reporting (If You Made Mistake)

### When to Self-Report
- ✅ Immediately when you realize mistake
- ✅ BEFORE finance catches it
- ✅ Even if it's embarrassing

### How to Self-Report
1. Go to finance office
2. Say: "I need to report a BAH discrepancy. My DEERS info is incorrect."
3. Provide documentation (divorce decree, custody order, etc.)
4. Ask for repayment plan

**What happens:**
- Finance calculates overpayment
- You repay (usually via paycheck deductions over 6-12 months)
- Counseling from commander (maybe)
- Usually NO court-martial if you self-report quickly

**Key:** Self-reporting shows good faith. Much better outcome than being caught.

## Common Questions

### Q: What if I marry someone I barely know - is that BAH fraud?
**A:** If it's a REAL marriage (you actually live together, have relationship), it's legal (even if fast). If it's FAKE (you marry for BAH, don't live together, no real relationship), it's fraud.

### Q: What if my ex and I live together but are divorced?
**A:** You get BAH without dependents. Your ex is NOT your dependent after divorce, even if living together.

### Q: Can I get BAH for my girlfriend/boyfriend?
**A:** NO. Must be legally married. Girlfriend/boyfriend = not a dependent.

### Q: What if my spouse deploys and I'm still receiving "with dependents" BAH?
**A:** That's legal. You're still married. They're still your dependent (even if deployed).

### Q: What if I have kids but not custody - can I claim "with dependents"?
**A:** NO. Must have custody (primary or joint). Paying child support alone doesn't qualify.

1. ✅ Stop immediately

4. ✅ Prepare to repay + face consequences

**Self-reporting fraud is still better than being caught. Shows some integrity, reduces punishment.**

**Remember:** BAH fraud is not worth it. Ever. The temporary financial gain ($5,000-$30,000) is wiped out by punishment (repayment + court-martial + discharge + loss of VA benefits = $100,000-$300,000 loss). If you made mistake, self-report. If you're considering fraud, DON'T. It always gets caught.
