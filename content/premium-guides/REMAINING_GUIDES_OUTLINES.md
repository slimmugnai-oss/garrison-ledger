## BASE LIFE & AMENITIES (3 Guides)

### Guide 18: On-Base vs. Off-Base Living: Financial & Lifestyle Comparison

**BLUF:** On-base is convenient but restrictive. Off-base gives freedom but costs more. For most E-5+, off-base is better - you keep extra BAH, build equity (if buying), and avoid base drama.

  - Security (gated base)
- **On-Base Cons:**
  - BAH goes 100% to housing (no extra cash)
  - Restrictions (noise, guests, decorations)
  - Inspections (some bases)
  - Quality varies (Fort Hood housing scandal)
  - Waitlists (6-12 months common)
- **Off-Base Pros:**
  - Keep extra BAH (if rent < BAH)
  - Freedom (no inspections, no rules)
  - Build equity (if buying)
  - Choose neighborhood/schools
- **Off-Base Cons:**
  - Commute (gas, time, traffic)
  - Utilities out of pocket
  - Landlord hassles
  - Isolation from military community
- **Financial Comparison:** E-5 at Fort Hood
  - BAH: $1,773/month
  - On-base: $0 extra cash
  - Off-base rent: $1,500/month, keep $273/month = **$3,276/year extra**
- **Real Example:** E-6 family chooses off-base, pockets $5,000/year, uses for TSP

### Guide 19: Commissary Strategy: What to Buy, What to Skip, How Much You Actually Save

**BLUF:** Commissary saves ~25% on groceries compared to civilian stores, but NOT everything is cheaper. Buy meat, dairy, produce. Skip canned goods, snacks, and cleaning supplies (cheaper at Walmart/Target). Save $200-400/month for E-5 family.

  - Meat (20-30% savings)
  - Dairy (15-25% savings)

  - Costco/Sam's Club for bulk items
- **Real Savings Calculation:** E-5 family spending $800/month on groceries
  - All commissary: Save $200/month (25% savings), but not optimal
