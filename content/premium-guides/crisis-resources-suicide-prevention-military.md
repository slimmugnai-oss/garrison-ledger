### If Someone Seems At Risk (But Hasn't Said So)

**Approach:**
- "Hey, I've noticed you seem down lately. Are you okay?"

## Common Suicide Myths (BUSTED)

### ❌ Myth #1: "Asking about suicide will plant the idea"
**Reality:** Asking SAVES lives. People in crisis feel RELIEF when someone asks directly.

### ❌ Myth #2: "People who talk about suicide don't actually do it"
**Reality:** 80% of people who die by suicide TOLD someone beforehand. Take all threats seriously.

### ❌ Myth #3: "Suicide happens without warning"
**Reality:** 80% show warning signs (withdrawal, giving away items, saying goodbye, mood changes).

### ❌ Myth #4: "Once someone is suicidal, they'll always be suicidal"
**Reality:** Suicidal crises are temporary. With treatment, 90% go on to live full lives and never attempt again.

### ❌ Myth #5: "Suicide is selfish / cowardly"
**Reality:** People in crisis are in unbearable pain and see no other option. Judgment doesn't help. Compassion does.
