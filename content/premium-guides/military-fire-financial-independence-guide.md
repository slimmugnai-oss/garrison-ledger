**Bottom Line Up Front:** Military members can achieve FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) faster than civilians due to: 20-year pension (worth $600K-$1.5M), free healthcare (TRICARE), housing allowance, TSP with match. FIRE number: 25x annual expenses. Save 50-70% of income, invest in TSP C Fund, live below BAH, retire at 42-45 with pension + investments = $80K-$120K/year passive income.

## FIRE Basics for Military

### What Is FIRE?

**Financial Independence:** Your investments generate enough income to cover expenses (you don't NEED to work)

**Retire Early:** Leave workforce before traditional retirement age (62-67)

**The 4% Rule:**
- Save 25x annual expenses
- Withdraw 4% per year
- Money lasts 30+ years (historically)

**Example:**
- Annual expenses: $60,000
- FIRE number: $60,000 × 25 = **$1,500,000**
- Safe withdrawal: $1,500,000 × 4% = $60,000/year

### Why Military Is Perfect for FIRE

**1. 20-Year Pension ($600K-$1.5M Value)**
- Retire at 38-42 (join at 18-22, serve 20 years)
- Pension: $2,500-$4,000/month for life
- **Equivalent to $750K-$1.2M invested** (at 4% withdrawal)

**2. Free Healthcare (TRICARE)**
- Saves $500-$1,200/month vs. civilian
- **Equivalent to $150K-$360K invested**

**3. Housing Allowance (BAH)**
- Live below BAH = save $500-$1,500/month
- **10 years = $60,000-$180,000 saved**

**4. TSP with 5% Match (BRS)**
- Free money: $87,000-$150,000 over career
- Invest in C Fund: Grows to $300,000-$500,000

**Total advantage:** Military FIRE is 5-10 years faster than civilian FIRE

## Common FIRE Mistakes for Military

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Maxing TSP Early
**Reality:** Contribute 10% to TSP for first 10 years. Miss out on compound growth.

**Fix:** Max TSP ($23K) as early as possible. Front-loaded investing beats dollar-cost-averaging due to compounding.

**Impact:** $23K/year for 20 years at 10% = $1,446,000  
vs. $10K/year for 20 years = $630,000  
**Difference: $816,000!**

### ❌ Mistake #2: Lifestyle Inflation with Every Promotion
**Reality:** Get promoted E-5 → E-6 (+$500/month). Increase spending $500/month. Save $0 extra.

**Fix:** Keep lifestyle flat. Bank every raise.

**Example:**
- E-5 expenses: $3,000/month
- Promote to E-6: +$500/month income
- Keep expenses at $3,000
- **Save extra $500/month = $6,000/year**

### ❌ Mistake #3: Buying Depreciating Assets (New Car Every 3 Years)
**Reality:** Buy $40,000 truck. Trade in every 3 years. Lose $15,000-$20,000 in depreciation each cycle.

**Fix:** Buy used car ($15,000-$20,000), drive for 10 years. Save $100,000+ over career.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Using Deployment for Massive Savings
**Reality:** Deploy. Spend deployment savings on truck when you return.

**Fix:** Deploy = Save $20,000-$40,000. Invest immediately in TSP/IRA. Don't touch.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Giving Up Because "FIRE Is Impossible on Military Pay"
**Reality:** "I only make $50K, FIRE is for rich people."

**Truth:** Military pension IS financial independence. You just need $500K-$1M in investments (not $2-3M like civilians).

**Fix:** Adjust FIRE number for pension. It's achievable.
