# Car Buying for Military: Discounts, Financing, and SCRA Benefits (2025)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Military discounts save $500-$3,000 on new cars. USAA/Navy Federal offer better rates than dealership financing (2-4% vs. 6-8%). SCRA caps interest at 6% on loans BEFORE active duty. Never buy at dealership near base (markup 20-30%). Buy end of month/year for best deals. Avoid extended warranties and add-ons.

## Car Buying Strategy (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Determine Budget (30 Days Before)

**Calculate:**
- Total car budget: 15-20% of annual income
- Monthly payment: No more than 10-15% of take-home pay

**Example: E-5 ($60,000 total comp)**
- Car budget: $9,000-$12,000
- Monthly payment limit: $450-$675

### Step 2: Get Pre-Approved (2 Weeks Before)

**Apply to:**
1. USAA
2. Navy Federal
3. PenFed

**Get:**
- Pre-approval letter
- Interest rate locked
- Maximum loan amount

**Why:** Gives you negotiating power at dealer

### Step 3: Research Car (1-2 Weeks)

**Use:**
- KBB.com (Kelley Blue Book) for fair price
- Edmunds.com for invoice price
- Consumer Reports for reliability ratings

**Determine:**
- Fair market value
- Invoice price (what dealer paid)
- Your target price (invoice + $500-$1,000)

### Step 4: Shop End of Month/Year

**Best times to buy:**
- Last week of month (dealers need to hit quotas)
- December (clearing inventory for new year)
- Labor Day/Memorial Day sales

**Worst times:**
- Beginning of month
- New model release

### Step 5: Negotiate (At Dealer)

**Start with:**
- "I'm pre-approved at [X]% APR"
- "I know invoice price is $Y"
- "I'll pay $Z (invoice + $500)"

**Avoid:**
- Monthly payment focus ("What payment can you afford?")
- Trade-in negotiation (do separately)
- Extended warranties (negotiate separately)

### Step 6: Review Contract (Before Signing)

**Check:**
- Purchase price matches agreed amount
- APR matches your pre-approval (if using dealer financing)
- No hidden fees ($500+ "doc fees" are often negotiable)
- No add-ons you didn't request

**Red flags:**
- "Processing fee" over $200
- "Paint protection" $500+
- "Gap insurance" $700+ (buy from USAA for $150)

## Common Car Buying Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Buying from Dealership Near Base
**Reality:** "Military specialists" mark up prices 20-30%. They prey on young enlisted with no credit.

**Fix:** Drive 30+ miles away. Shop at volume dealers in big cities.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Focusing on Monthly Payment
**Reality:** Salesman: "I can get you to $400/month!" (by extending loan to 84 months at 8% APR)

**Fix:** Negotiate PRICE first, then discuss financing.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Buying Extended Warranty at Dealer
**Reality:** Dealer charges $2,000 for warranty. Same warranty from manufacturer: $800.

**Fix:** Decline all add-ons. Buy warranty directly from manufacturer later (if needed).

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Getting Pre-Approved
**Reality:** You go to dealer with no financing. They "find you financing" at 9% APR. Your credit union would've given 3.5%.

**Fix:** Get pre-approved before shopping.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Trading In Car at Dealer
**Reality:** Dealer lowballs trade-in by $2,000. You think you're getting deal because they raised your new car price to compensate.

**Fix:** Sell car privately (CarMax, Carvana, or private party). Get $2,000-$4,000 more.

## Should You Buy or Lease?

### Buy If:
- ✅ Staying in one location 3+ years
- ✅ Drive 12,000+ miles/year
- ✅ Want to own car outright
- ✅ Plan to keep car 5+ years

### Lease If:
- ✅ PCSing every 2-3 years (can break lease with SCRA)
- ✅ Drive <12,000 miles/year
- ✅ Want new car every 2-3 years
- ✅ Can afford monthly payments

### Buy vs. Lease Example:

**Buying ($25,000 car):**
- Down payment: $5,000
- Loan: $20,000 at 3.5% for 60 months
- Monthly: $364
- After 5 years: Own car worth $12,000

**Leasing (same $25,000 car):**
- Down payment: $2,000
- Lease: $350/month for 36 months
- After 3 years: Return car, owe $0, own nothing

## PCS and Cars

### Shipping POV (Personally Owned Vehicle)

**Government pays:**
- 1 POV shipment per PCS
- CONUS to OCONUS (or vice versa)
- Takes 30-90 days

**Process:**
1. Schedule vehicle inspection (VPC - Vehicle Processing Center)
2. Submit for shipping
3. Pick up at destination

**Don't ship if:**
- Car is old/unreliable (expensive to fix OCONUS)
- Gas guzzler (gas is $6-8/gal in Europe)
- Not paid off (still making payments = risky)

### Selling Car Before PCS

**Best options:**
1. **CarMax:** Instant cash offer, no haggling
2. **Carvana:** Online offer, pickup at your home
3. **Private party:** Craigslist/Facebook (get $1,000-$3,000 more than CarMax)

**Remember:** Car dealers see military members as easy targets. Don't fall for high-pressure sales, inflated prices, or predatory financing. Get pre-approved, know fair price, negotiate hard, and walk away if deal isn't right. Your BAH isn't free money — don't blow it on a car payment.
