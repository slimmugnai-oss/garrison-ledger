# Moving Pets During PCS: Complete Guide to Pet Relocation (CONUS & OCONUS)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** PCS with pets requires planning 3-6 months ahead (especially for OCONUS/Hawaii). Costs: $200-$500 CONUS, $2,000-$5,000 OCONUS per pet. Get health certificate (<10 days before travel), update rabies vaccine, microchip required for most locations. Airlines charge $125-$200 in-cabin (small pets), $200-$500 cargo (large dogs). OCONUS destinations require quarantine (UK: 0 days if compliant, Hawaii: 0-120 days, Japan: 0-180 days). Use pet shipping companies for complex moves ($3,000-$6,000 but handles everything).

## Common PCS Pet Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Waiting Until Last Minute (OCONUS)

**Reality:**
- Orders: 2 months out
- You research Hawaii requirements
- Rabies titer test requires 120-day wait
- You miss window, pet stuck in quarantine ($1,680!)

**Fix:** Research requirements IMMEDIATELY when you get orders (or before)

### ❌ Mistake #2: Wrong Microchip Type

**Reality:**
- Get microchip at local vet
- Non-ISO compliant chip
- Arrive in Japan, chip not readable
- Pet quarantined 180 days

**Fix:** Verify ISO 11784/11785 compliant chip (tell vet "International travel chip")

### ❌ Mistake #3: Booking Non-Pet-Friendly Flight

**Reality:**
- Book cheapest flight (Spirit, Frontier)
- These airlines don't allow pets
- Must rebook on different airline ($$$)

**Fix:** Check airline pet policy BEFORE booking ticket

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Acclimating Pet to Crate

**Reality:**
- Buy crate day before PCS
- Pet has never been in crate
- Freaks out during flight (stress, accidents)

**Fix:** Practice 30 days before flight (feed meals in crate, sleep in crate)
