# Military Life Insurance: SGLI vs. VGLI vs. Civilian Policies Complete Comparison

**Bottom Line Up Front:** SGLI ($500K for $32/month) is mandatory and cheapest while active duty. After separation, compare VGLI ($50-$310/month depending on age) vs. civilian term life ($30-$200/month). Under 40 and healthy = civilian term life cheaper. Over 50 or health issues = VGLI better (no medical exam if convert within 240 days). Most need $500K-$1M total coverage (10x annual income).

| **Cost (age 30)** | $32/month | $50/month | $30-$50/month |
| **Cost (age 50)** | $32/month | $160/month | $80-$150/month |
| **Medical exam** | No | No (if convert within 240 days) | Yes |
| **Availability** | Active duty only | Veterans only | Anyone |
| **Portable** | No (ends at separation) | Yes | Yes |

## Civilian Term Life Insurance

### Best Providers for Veterans

**1. USAA Term Life**
- **Rates:** Competitive ($35-$45/month for $500K at age 30)
- **Benefits:** Military-friendly, easy process
- **Medical exam:** Required (paramedic comes to your home)

**2. Navy Federal Term Life**
- **Rates:** Similar to USAA
- **Benefits:** Bundling with other products
- **Medical exam:** Required

**3. SBLI (The Savings Bank Life Insurance)**
- **Rates:** Often lowest
- **Benefits:** Direct (no agents), simple online application
- **Medical exam:** Required

**4. Ladder Life**
- **Rates:** Very competitive for healthy individuals
- **Benefits:** 100% online, instant quotes
- **Medical exam:** Required (or questionnaire only for lower amounts)

### Term Life vs. Whole Life (DON'T BUY WHOLE LIFE)

**Term Life:**
- Coverage for set period (10, 20, 30 years)
- Cheap ($40/month for $500K)
- No cash value
- **Best for:** 95% of military members

**Whole Life:**
- Coverage for entire life
- Builds cash value
- Expensive ($300-$500/month for $500K)
- Complex, high fees

**Why whole life is usually BAD:**
- 10x more expensive than term
- "Cash value" grows at 2-3% (worse than TSP C Fund at 10%)
- Agents earn huge commissions (why they push it)

**Exception:** Estate planning for wealthy (>$10M net worth)

**For military members:** Stick with term life. Invest difference in TSP.

## How Much Life Insurance Do You Need?

### The 10x Rule (Simple)
**Need:** 10x your annual income

**Examples:**
- E-5 ($60K/year) → Need $600K
- E-7 ($80K/year) → Need $800K
- O-3 ($100K/year) → Need $1M

### Detailed Method (More Accurate)

**Calculate actual needs:**
1. **Income replacement:** $60,000/year × 10 years = $600,000
2. **Debts to pay off:** $30,000 (car, credit cards)
3. **Mortgage payoff:** $200,000 (so spouse owns home free)
4. **College for kids:** $100,000 ($50K per kid × 2)
5. **Emergency fund:** $20,000
6. **Total need: $950,000**

**Your coverage:**
- SGLI: $500,000
- Additional civilian: $450,000
- **Total: $950,000** ✅

### Coverage by Life Stage

**Single, no kids:**
- Minimum: $100,000-$250,000 (cover funeral, debts)

**Married, no kids:**
- Minimum: $500,000 (SGLI sufficient)
- Better: $750,000 (add $250K civilian term)

**Married with kids:**
- Minimum: $750,000
- Better: $1,000,000-$1,500,000
