# Military Divorce: BAH, Retirement, TSP & Child Support (Complete Guide 2025)

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Divorce doesn't automatically entitle your spouse to military benefits. 20/20/20 rule (20 years married, 20 years service, 20 years overlap) = full benefits. 10-year rule applies to retirement division. BAH stops when divorce finalizes. Child support calculated based on state laws, not military regs. Get a lawyer who understands military divorce.

## The 20/20/20 and 20/20/15 Rules

### 20/20/20 Rule (Full Benefits)
**If ALL three apply:**
- Married for 20+ years
- Service member served 20+ years
- 20+ years of marriage overlapped with service

**Former spouse gets:**
- ✅ Full commissary/exchange privileges
- ✅ TRICARE (at own expense, not free)
- ✅ Access to MWR facilities
- ✅ ID card

**Example:**

- **Spouse qualifies for 20/20/20**

### 20/20/15 Rule (Limited Benefits)
**If ALL three apply:**
- Married for 20+ years

- 15+ years of marriage overlapped with service

## Military Retirement Division

### The 10-Year Rule
**If married 10+ years during service:**
- Court CAN award portion of retirement to former spouse
- DFAS will pay spouse directly (if ordered by court)

**If married LESS than 10 years:**
- Court can still award retirement in divorce
- BUT service member must pay spouse directly (DFAS won't do it)

### How Retirement Is Divided

**Formula (most states use):**
```
Spouse's share = (Years married during service / Total years of service) × 50%
```

**Example 1:**
- Married for 15 years
- Service member served 20 years total
- Divorce after retirement

**Calculation:**
- Marital share: 15 / 20 = 75% of retirement was earned during marriage
- Spouse gets: 75% × 50% = **37.5% of retirement**

**Monthly payment:**
- Retirement: $3,000/month
- Spouse gets: $1,125/month
- Service member keeps: $1,875/month

**Example 2:**
- Married for 8 years
- Service member served 20 years
- Divorce before retirement

**Calculation:**
- Marital share: 8 / 20 = 40%
- Spouse gets: 40% × 50% = **20% of future retirement**
- BUT service member must pay spouse directly (DFAS won't — under 10 years)

### DFAS Direct Payment
**Requirements:**
- Married 10+ years during service
- Court order sent to DFAS
- Former spouse submits DD Form 2293

**Process:**
1. Divorce decree awarded spouse portion of retirement
2. Former spouse submits court order to DFAS
3. DFAS divides payment automatically
4. Both get 1099-R tax forms (both pay taxes on their portions)

## BAH After Divorce

### BAH With-Dependents Stops Immediately

**Rule:**
- Once divorce finalizes, you NO LONGER have a dependent spouse
- BAH switches from "with dependents" to "without dependents"
- Effective 1st of month after divorce

**Example:**
- E-7 in San Diego
- BAH with dependents: $2,940/month
- BAH without dependents: $2,295/month
- **Loss: $645/month ($7,740/year)**

### BAH With-Dependents Continues IF You Have Kids

**If you have custody or joint custody of kids:**
- You keep "with dependents" BAH
- Even if ex-spouse remarries

**If ex-spouse has primary custody:**
- You lose "with dependents" BAH
- Switch to "without dependents"
- But you still pay child support (separate)

---

## Child Support in Military Divorce

### How It's Calculated
**Based on STATE law, not military regulations**

**Typical formula:**
- Income-based percentage
- Number of children
- Custody arrangement

**Example (California):**
- 1 child: 20-25% of gross income
- 2 children: 25-30% of gross income
- 3+ children: 30-40% of gross income

### What Counts as "Income" for Child Support?

**Included:**
- ✅ Base pay
- ✅ BAH (in most states)
- ✅ BAS (in some states)
- ✅ Special pay (hazard, flight, sea duty)

**Excluded:**
- ❌ VA disability (in most states)
- ❌ Combat pay (varies by state)

**Example:**
- E-6 with $55,000/year total income (base + BAH + BAS)
- 2 kids
- California: 28% of gross income
- **Child support: $15,400/year ($1,283/month)**

### Child Support + BAH Loss = Double Hit

**Scenario:**
- Before divorce: BAH with deps = $2,940/month
- After divorce: BAH without deps = $2,295/month
- Child support: $1,283/month
- **Net loss: $645 + $1,283 = $1,928/month**

## TSP Division in Divorce

### TSP Is Divisible Property
- Courts can award portion of TSP to former spouse
- Requires court order (Qualified Domestic Relations Order - QDRO equivalent for TSP)

### How TSP Is Divided

**Option 1: Transfer to Former Spouse's TSP Account**
- No taxes or penalties (if done correctly)
- Former spouse gets own TSP account
- Can manage investments independently

**Option 2: Cash Out (BAD IDEA)**
- Former spouse takes lump sum
- 20% federal withholding
- 10% early withdrawal penalty (if under 59.5)
- State taxes
- **Could lose 40-50% to taxes/penalties**

**Example:**
- TSP balance: $200,000
- Court awards spouse 50%: $100,000
- Transfer to spouse's TSP: $100,000 (no taxes)
- Cash out: $100,000 - $20,000 tax - $10,000 penalty = **$70,000**

### Process
1. Include TSP division in divorce decree
2. Submit court order to TSP (TSP-13 form)
3. TSP processes transfer
4. Former spouse can roll to IRA or keep in TSP

## Alimony (Spousal Support)

### Military Members CAN Be Ordered to Pay Alimony

**Factors courts consider:**
- Length of marriage
- Spouse's ability to work
- Standard of living during marriage
- Contributions to service member's career (stayed home, moved with them, etc.)

**Typical alimony:**
- Short marriage (<10 years): Rare, unless spouse has no job skills
- Long marriage (10-20 years): Possible, 2-5 years of support
- Very long marriage (20+ years): Possible indefinite support

**Amounts vary:**
- 20-40% of service member's income
- Temporary (rehabilitative) or permanent

**Tax treatment (post-2018 divorces):**
- Alimony is NO LONGER tax-deductible for payer
- Alimony is NO LONGER taxable income for recipient
- (This changed under Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017)

## SGLI (Life Insurance) Beneficiary After Divorce

### SGLI Does NOT Auto-Update
**Critical:** Even after divorce, if you don't change beneficiary, your EX-SPOUSE could get $400,000 if you die.

**Action steps:**
1. Log into myPay
2. Update SGLI beneficiary
3. Change to kids, new partner, or parents
4. **Do this IMMEDIATELY after divorce**

## Common Divorce Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Not Hiring a Military-Savvy Lawyer
**Reality:** Civilian divorce lawyer doesn't understand 20/20/20 rule, DFAS retirement division, etc.

**Fix:** Hire lawyer experienced in military divorce. Worth the extra cost.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Agreeing to "We'll Split Everything 50/50" Without Calculating
**Reality:** You agree to split retirement 50/50, thinking it's fair. Turns out you were only married 5 years of your 20-year career. You just gave away 2.5x more than fair share.

**Fix:** Use the formula. Only split marital portion of retirement.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Updating SGLI Beneficiary
**Reality:** You die in deployment. Ex-spouse gets $400,000. Your kids get $0.

**Fix:** Update SGLI within 1 week of divorce finalization.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Thinking BAH Will Continue Forever
**Reality:** You budget for $2,940/month BAH. Divorce finalizes. BAH drops to $2,295. You can't afford rent + child support.

**Fix:** Budget for BAH without dependents BEFORE divorce. Prepare financially.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Cashing Out TSP (Instead of Transferring)
**Reality:** Spouse takes $100,000 TSP lump sum. Loses $30,000 to taxes/penalties.

**Fix:** Transfer TSP to former spouse's account (tax-free).
