# Civilian Resume Writing for Military Veterans: Complete Conversion Guide

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Civilian resumes are 1-2 pages (not 5-10 like federal resumes), focus on RESULTS not DUTIES, and NEVER use military jargon. The formula: Translate MOS → Job Title, Quantify Achievements, Use Action Verbs, Remove all acronyms. Most veteran resumes fail because they read like duty descriptions instead of accomplishment statements.

## Military vs. Civilian Resume: Key Differences

| **Military Resume (BAD)** | **Civilian Resume (GOOD)** |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| 5-10 pages | 1-2 pages MAX |
| Lists duties | Shows RESULTS & impact |
| "Responsible for..." | "Achieved... Led... Increased..." |
| Military jargon (MOS, TTP, SOP) | Plain English |
| Chronological (every job) | Highlights relevant experience |
| "Supervised 12 personnel" | "Led team of 12, improving productivity 30%" |

**Bad:**
> "Supervised team of soldiers and conducted training."

## Common Veteran Resume Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Resume Is Too Long
**Reality:** Civilian recruiters spend 6-10 seconds per resume. 3+ pages = instant reject.

**Fix:** 1-2 pages maximum. Cut everything that doesn't support the job you're applying for.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Using Military Acronyms
**Reality:** Civilian hiring managers don't know what "NCOIC" or "PMCS" means.

**Fix:** Translate EVERYTHING into civilian language.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Listing Duties Instead of Achievements
**Reality:** "Responsible for..." statements are boring and don't show impact.

**Fix:** Use STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for every bullet.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Tailoring Resume to Job
**Reality:** Generic resumes get rejected by ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems).

**Fix:** Customize resume for EACH job by including keywords from job description.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Including Irrelevant Information
**Reality:** Hiring managers don't care about unrelated military schools or awards.

**Fix:** Only include information relevant to the job you're applying for.
