# Fix Ask Military Expert AI Voice & Tone

## Problem

The AI currently sounds robotic by restating user context ("As an E-5 at Fort Hood..."). Need natural, mentor-like tone.

## Target Voice Profile

- **Tone:** Experienced mentor (authoritative but warm)
- **Context:** Only mention rank/base when clarifying, not restating
- **Length:** Medium (informative, not overwhelming)
- **Vibe:** Knowledgeable friend (supportive + confident)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Read Current Prompt System

- Review `app/api/ask/submit/route.ts` â†’ `buildPrompt()` function
- Identify verbose mirroring instructions
- Note current personality guidelines

### 2. Rewrite System Prompt

- Remove "acknowledge user's context" instructions
- Add explicit tone rules:
- "You're an experienced military mentor, not a database"
- "Never restate information the user already provided"
- "Only mention rank/base when it clarifies your answer"
- "Write conversationally, like advising a friend"
- Add good/bad response examples

### 3. Update User Context Injection

- Keep profile data available to AI (silently)
- Remove instructions to "acknowledge" it
- Let AI use context naturally when needed

### 4. Test & Verify

- Test sample questions
- Verify natural tone
- Check context is still used correctly

### 5. Deploy

- Commit changes
- Push to production
