    "html": "<p>The G Fund is unique to the TSP and represents the safest investment option within the plan.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Composition & Objective:</strong> The G Fund is invested exclusively in nonmarketable short-term U.S. Treasury securities that are specially issued to the TSP.3 The payment of both principal and interest is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, meaning there is no credit risk or market risk; the value of G Fund securities does not fluctuate.4 Its investment objective is to ensure the preservation of capital while generating returns that are higher than those of short-term U.S. Treasury bills.3  </li>\n  <li><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> The G Fund's principal is fully protected from loss, making it the lowest-risk fund in the TSP.6 Its primary vulnerability is <strong>inflation risk</strong>—the possibility that its returns will not grow enough to offset the reduction in purchasing power caused by inflation over the long term.4  </li>\n  <li><strong>The \"G Fund Yield Advantage\":</strong> A distinct feature of the G Fund is its interest rate calculation. The rate is determined by the U.S. Treasury and is equal to the weighted average yield of all outstanding Treasury notes and bonds with four or more years to maturity.4 This mechanism allows a fund composed of short-term, risk-free securities to earn a long-term interest rate. Because long-term rates are generally higher than short-term rates, the G Fund has historically delivered premium yields compared to other \"safe\" investments like money market funds, bank CDs, and high-yield savings accounts, all without the price volatility (interest rate risk) associated with holding long-term bonds directly.8  </li>\n  <li><em> <strong>Strategic Role:</strong> The G Fund serves as the ultimate \"safe harbor\" within a TSP portfolio. It is ideal for capital preservation, especially for investors nearing or in retirement who prioritize stability over growth.5 Strategically, it also functions as a temporary holding place for funds during periods of market volatility. TSP rules permit unlimited interfund transfers (IFTs) </em>into* the G Fund each month after the first two IFTs, which can be used to reallocate money among any funds. This makes the G Fund a key tool for active risk management.3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>#</p>",

    "html": "<p>The I Fund is the TSP's international stock fund, providing crucial diversification outside of the United States.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Composition & Objective:</strong> In a significant recent change, the I Fund's objective is now to match the performance of the MSCI ACWI IMI ex USA ex China ex Hong Kong Index.16 This transition from the older, more limited MSCI EAFE Index represents a major strategic enhancement. The new index includes over 5,000 large, medium, and small-cap stocks across 44 developed and emerging market countries, including Canada.16 As the name implies, it specifically excludes stocks from the United States, China, and Hong Kong.16 The exclusion of China was a directive from the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) following guidance from the Department of Labor amid political and national security concerns.18  </li>\n  <li><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> The I Fund is subject to <strong>market risk</strong> from international stock market fluctuations and <strong>inflation risk</strong>.16 It also carries a significant degree of <strong>currency risk</strong>: the fund's returns will be impacted by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies of the countries represented in the index. A stronger dollar can reduce returns, while a weaker dollar can enhance them.16  </li>\n  <li><strong>Strategic Role:</strong> The I Fund is the sole vehicle within the TSP's core funds for gaining international stock exposure. It is an excellent way to diversify the equity portion of a portfolio, reducing home-country bias and capturing growth opportunities from around the globe.11 Investors who desire complete global market exposure must supplement the I Fund with investments in Chinese and Hong Kong equities, which can be done through the TSP's Mutual Fund Window.17</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The ultra-low expense ratios of the TSP funds represent one of their most significant, yet often underappreciated, advantages. As of late 2024, the total expense ratios were exceptionally low: 0.037% for the G and F Funds, 0.036% for the C Fund, 0.051% for the S Fund, and 0.038% for the I Fund.4 These costs, which translate to paying between $0.36 and $0.51 per $1,000 invested annually, are often lower than even the most competitive index funds and ETFs available in the commercial market. While a difference of a few basis points may seem negligible in a single year, the effect of this cost advantage compounds dramatically over a 30- or 40-year military or federal career. This compounding effect can result in a final retirement balance that is tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars larger than an identical portfolio held in a higher-cost commercial account. This structural advantage makes a compelling case for service members to retain their assets within the TSP even after separating from service, rather than immediately rolling them over to a private IRA, a move often encouraged by financial advisors who may benefit from asset management fees.

    "html": "<p>For deployed service members, the Roth vs. Traditional decision becomes uniquely and powerfully skewed in favor of the Roth option. Pay earned while serving in a designated combat zone is exempt from federal income tax.22 This creates an unparalleled financial opportunity:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>When tax-exempt combat pay is contributed to a <strong>Roth TSP</strong>, the money goes in tax-free (due to combat zone status) and grows tax-free. Upon qualified withdrawal, both the contributions and all earnings come out completely tax-free.19 This represents a \"double tax-free\" benefit that has no civilian equivalent and is one of the most potent wealth-building tools available to the military.  </li>\n  <li><em> In contrast, when tax-exempt pay is contributed to a <strong>Traditional TSP</strong>, the contributions themselves are also tax-free upon withdrawal. However, all the </em>earnings* generated by those contributions are fully taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal.19</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given that earnings often constitute the majority of an account's value over a long career, the Roth TSP is unequivocally the superior choice for any contributions made from tax-exempt combat pay.</p>\n\n<p>A critical nuance for members of the Blended Retirement System (BRS) is how these contributions interact with annual IRS limits. Tax-exempt contributions made to a <strong>Roth</strong> balance <em>do</em> count against the annual elective deferral limit. However, tax-exempt contributions made to a <strong>Traditional</strong> balance <em>do not</em>.19 This creates a strategic trade-off. A service member who contributes heavily to their Roth TSP from combat pay early in the year might hit the elective deferral limit and be unable to make further contributions, thereby forgoing valuable government matching funds for the remainder of the year. This requires careful planning to balance the powerful tax advantages of Roth with the goal of receiving the full 5% government match throughout the year.</p>\n\n<p>It is also important to note that all agency/service automatic (1%) and matching contributions are always deposited into the participant's Traditional TSP balance, regardless of their own contribution choice.20 Consequently, any participant receiving matching funds will inherently have both Traditional and Roth balances if they contribute to the Roth option.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Table 2: Roth vs. Traditional TSP Decision Matrix</strong></p>\n\n<p>| Decision Factor | Favors Roth TSP | Favors Traditional TSP | Strategic Considerations for Military |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| <strong>Current Tax Bracket</strong> | You are in a low tax bracket (e.g., junior enlisted). 1 | You are in a high tax bracket (e.g., senior officer). 19 | Military pay scales are progressive; younger members are typically in lower brackets, making early-career Roth contributions highly effective. |\n| <strong>Expected Future Income</strong> | You expect higher income and a higher tax bracket in retirement. 19 | You expect lower income and a lower tax bracket in retirement. 19 | A military pension is taxable income. Consider how this, plus Social Security and other assets, will affect your retirement tax bracket. |\n| <strong>Combat Zone Deployment</strong> | <strong>Strongly Favored.</strong> Contributions are made tax-free and withdrawn tax-free, along with all earnings. 19 | Not favored. Contributions are withdrawn tax-free, but all earnings are taxable. 19 | This is the most compelling reason for a service member to use the Roth TSP. The tax savings on decades of compounded growth are immense. |\n| <strong>Future Tax Rate Uncertainty</strong> | You believe federal income tax rates will generally be higher in the future. | You believe federal income tax rates will be lower or the same in the future. | Paying taxes now at known rates eliminates the risk of potentially much higher tax rates decades from now, acting as a form of tax diversification. |\n| <strong>Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)</strong> | Roth TSP balances are not subject to RMDs during the original owner's lifetime. 19 | Traditional TSP balances are subject to RMDs starting at a certain age. | Roth provides greater flexibility for estate planning and allows funds to continue growing tax-free for longer if not needed for income. |</p>\n\n<p>Beyond a simple calculation of current versus future tax rates, choosing the Roth TSP can be viewed as a sophisticated risk management strategy. The standard analysis assumes a degree of certainty about future tax policy that may not be warranted. Given long-term fiscal pressures on the U.S. government, it is plausible that federal income tax rates could be significantly higher for all income brackets in the coming decades. By contributing to a Roth account, an investor locks in today's tax rates on their contributions, effectively insuring their retirement portfolio's growth against the systemic risk of future tax hikes. This transforms the Roth decision from a mere tax-timing exercise into a valuable hedge, providing tax diversification and greater certainty for long-term financial planning. For younger service members with decades until retirement, this adds substantial weight to the argument for prioritizing Roth contributions.</p>",

This aligns with a traditional retirement path. However, if a 40-year-old service member is defaulted into the L 2045 fund, that fund's allocation will begin to de-risk significantly as it approaches 2045, shifting heavily into the G and F funds.26 This occurs even though the service member, supported by a military pension, may not need to touch their TSP funds for another 15-20 years. This premature de-risking can cause the investor to forgo decades of potential market growth, resulting in a substantially smaller retirement nest egg. The military pension provides a stable income floor, which increases a retiree's capacity to tolerate market risk in their TSP portfolio for a longer period.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, military members who choose to use L Funds should select a fund based on their <em>planned withdrawal date</em>, not their military retirement date. This often means choosing an L Fund with a target date 15-20 years beyond their separation from service. Alternatively, and perhaps more optimally, they can use a custom allocation. By understanding the specific allocations within each L Fund (as shown in Table 3), an investor can create their own mix that maintains a higher, more appropriate equity exposure for their true time horizon, avoiding the premature conservatism of the default L Fund glide path.</p>",

When a loan is taken, that amount of money is removed from its investment in the C, S, and I funds and is no longer participating in the market.28 The participant misses out on all the compound earnings that money could have generated. The interest paid back to oneself (the G Fund rate, e.g., 4-5%) is almost always lower than the long-term average returns of the stock market (e.g., 8-10%). This differential in returns, compounded over many years, can result in a final account balance that is tens of thousands of dollars smaller than it would have been without the loan.31  </li>\n  <li><strong>Reduced Contributions and Lost Matching:</strong> The financial burden of loan repayments, which are deducted directly from pay, can lead participants to reduce or completely stop their regular TSP contributions.28 For FERS and BRS members, contributing less than 5% of their pay means they are forfeiting free money in the form of government matching contributions, further compounding the negative impact on their retirement savings.28  </li>\n  <li><em> <strong>Potential for Double Taxation:</strong> For loans taken from a Traditional (pre-tax) TSP balance, repayments are made with after-tax dollars from a paycheck.

Instead of starting with a broad career field, a spouse should identify a specific, in-demand job title that can be obtained <em>directly</em> with a certification or Associate's degree that falls within the MyCAA funding limits.

    "html": "<p>While individual, detailed narratives are often anecdotal, the collective story is one of empowerment. Spouses have successfully used MyCAA funding to launch careers in nursing, IT, cybersecurity, and medical administration, among many other fields.76 One spouse, who used MyCAA to attend community college, noted how easy the sign-up process was and how it enabled her to pursue a teaching career.83 These stories underscore the program's effectiveness in helping spouses overcome the financial barriers to education and build professional identities that can thrive alongside a military career. The expansion of MyCAA eligibility to include spouses of more senior service members is a testament to the program's recognized success and its importance to military family readiness and financial well-being.84</p>\n\n<p>## <strong>Part IV: The Savings Deposit Program (SDP): From Deployment Savings to Strategic Investment</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Savings Deposit Program (SDP) is a unique and highly lucrative financial benefit available exclusively to service members deployed in designated combat zones. Offering a guaranteed high rate of return, the SDP provides an unparalleled opportunity to rapidly accumulate capital during a deployment. Strategically managing the program during deployment and thoughtfully investing the payout upon reintegration are key components of an advanced military financial plan.</p>",

    "html": "<ol>\n  <li><strong>Eliminate High-Interest Debt:</strong> The most immediate and highest \"guaranteed return\" an individual can achieve is paying off debt with an interest rate higher than what they could reliably earn in the market.

This fund should be kept in a liquid, high-yield savings account.  </li>\n  <li><strong>Fund Tax-Advantaged Retirement Accounts:</strong> If high-interest debt is not an issue and an emergency fund is in place, the next priority should be tax-advantaged investing. The SDP payout can be used to make a full year's contribution to a Roth IRA. Alternatively, the funds can be held in savings to supplement living expenses while the service member dramatically increases their TSP contribution percentage to max it out for the year.  </li>\n  <li><strong>Invest in Real Estate:</strong> For those pursuing real estate investment, the SDP payout can serve as a down payment on a conventional investment property or cover the closing costs and initial repair budget for a VA loan house-hack property.  </li>\n  <li><strong>Fund Other Financial Goals:</strong> The payout can also be allocated toward other medium-term goals, such as saving for a child's education in a 529 plan, funding a vehicle purchase with cash to avoid a loan, or investing in a taxable brokerage account.</li>\n</ol>",

This typically results in a significant decrease in net monthly income.94  </li>\n  <li><strong>Coordinate SDP Withdrawal:</strong> Monitor myPay to ensure the SDP funds are withdrawn and deposited correctly. To maximize the 10% return, it is best to leave the funds in the account for the full 90 days post-deployment before withdrawing.94  </li>\n  <li><strong>Review Legal and Insurance Documents:</strong> Any temporary Power of Attorney documents established for the deployment should be reviewed and revoked if no longer needed. It is also a good time to review and update wills, beneficiary designations on life insurance and retirement accounts (like the SGLI and TSP), and auto insurance policies (which may have been reduced or suspended for a stored vehicle).94  </li>\n  <li><strong>Check Credit Reports:</strong> It is a prudent security measure to check credit reports from all three major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) for free at annualcreditreport.com.

    "html": "<p>The concept of a financial flywheel describes a system where each component's output accelerates the input of the next, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of growth. For a service member, a deployment can trigger just such a flywheel, transforming a period of personal sacrifice into an extraordinary opportunity for financial acceleration.</p>\n\n<p>This flywheel effect connects the major themes of this report into a single, actionable strategy. The process begins with a deployment, which provides access to tax-free pay. This tax-advantaged income is then strategically channeled into two powerful programs: the Roth TSP and the Savings Deposit Program. Contributions to the Roth TSP from combat pay create a \"double tax-free\" benefit, where money goes in tax-free, grows tax-free, and is withdrawn tax-free. Simultaneously, funds are deposited into the SDP to capture a guaranteed 10% annual return.</p>\n\n<p>Upon returning from deployment, the SDP payout provides a significant lump sum of capital. This capital is not treated as a windfall for consumption but as a strategic asset to be deployed. It can be used to acquire a cash-flowing asset, such as a multi-unit property purchased with a VA loan in a \"house hack\" scenario. Alternatively, it can be used to eliminate high-interest debt, which frees up monthly cash flow.</p>\n\n<p>This newly created positive cash flow—either from rental income or from eliminated debt payments—is then directed toward increasing the service member's base-level TSP contributions. This action not only accelerates retirement savings but also ensures the capture of the full 5% government match under the BRS. Each step in this process feeds and amplifies the next, creating a powerful, self-reinforcing cycle of wealth creation that is uniquely available to members of the military.</p>\n\n<p>Case Study: The Deployment Flywheel in Action  \nConsider a hypothetical E-6 with a family, embarking on a 12-month deployment to a combat zone.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Deployment & Savings:</strong> During deployment, the service member's family lives frugally on their BAH and their spouse's income. The E-6's entire tax-free base pay and special pays are allocated. They contribute $10,000 to the SDP as quickly as possible and then contribute the maximum allowed amount to their Roth TSP.  </li>\n  <li><strong>Return & Payout:</strong> Upon returning, they receive an SDP payout of approximately $11,000 (principal plus interest). Their Roth TSP has also grown, and all contributions were effectively tax-free.  </li>\n  <li><strong>Capital Deployment:</strong> The family uses the $11,000 SDP payout to cover the closing costs on a $350,000 duplex purchased with a $0-down VA loan near their new duty station.  </li>\n  <li><strong>House Hack & Cash Flow:</strong> They live in one unit of the duplex and rent the other unit for $1,500 per month. After accounting for the mortgage (PITI), maintenance, and other expenses, the rental income covers the majority of their housing cost, freeing up an additional $1,200 per month in their budget.  </li>\n  <li><strong>Accelerate Investments:</strong> This new $1,200 in monthly cash flow is used to increase the service member's TSP contribution, allowing them to easily contribute over 15% of their base pay, well above the 5% needed to get the full match.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In just over a year, this service member has leveraged a deployment to acquire an income-producing asset, dramatically increase their retirement savings rate, and significantly boost their family's net worth, demonstrating the powerful synergy of an integrated financial strategy.</p>",

They should be understood and utilized to their fullest extent.  </li>\n  <li><strong>Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:</strong> Consistently contribute to the TSP and IRAs. The choice between Roth and Traditional should be a deliberate, strategic decision based on an analysis of one's financial trajectory, with a strong bias toward Roth for combat-zone contributions and for younger service members.  </li>\n  <li><strong>Embrace the Investor Mindset:</strong> View housing not just as a place to live but as a potential investment. The \"buy, occupy, rent, repeat\" strategy, enabled by the VA loan and frequent PCS moves, is a proven path to wealth for military families.  </li>\n  <li><strong>Focus on Long-Term Compound Growth:</strong> The most powerful force in finance is compound earnings over time. Avoid actions that disrupt this process, such as taking unnecessary TSP loans. Start investing early, contribute consistently, and maintain a long-term perspective through market cycles.98  </li>\n  <li><strong>Create a Personalized Financial Plan:</strong> The strategies in this guide provide a blueprint, but each family's situation is unique.
