# ü§ñ AUTOMATION SUMMARY

## What AI Agents Do Automatically vs. What You Must Do

---

## ‚úÖ **AUTOMATED (AI Handles This)**

### **Code Quality**
- ‚úÖ Follow `.cursorrules` coding standards
- ‚úÖ Use TypeScript types properly
- ‚úÖ Follow React/Next.js best practices
- ‚úÖ Use existing UI components
- ‚úÖ Implement RLS policies on database tables
- ‚úÖ Add authentication checks to API routes
- ‚úÖ Handle errors gracefully
- ‚úÖ Run linter before committing

### **Development Process**
- ‚úÖ Create TODO lists for complex tasks (3+ steps)
- ‚úÖ Read SYSTEM_STATUS.md when you reference it
- ‚úÖ Follow DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md process
- ‚úÖ Break down complex features into steps
- ‚úÖ Test functionality, mobile, authentication
- ‚úÖ Write good commit messages

### **Documentation**
- ‚úÖ Create feature documentation (when reminded)
- ‚úÖ Update SYSTEM_STATUS.md (when reminded)
- ‚úÖ Update CHANGELOG.md (when reminded)
- ‚úÖ Add code comments for complex logic
- ‚úÖ Follow documentation templates

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES**

### **Critical - You MUST Do These:**

#### **1. Read SYSTEM_STATUS.md (30 seconds)**
**When:** At the start of EVERY work session

**How:**
```bash
cat SYSTEM_STATUS.md | head -50
```

**Why:** AI agents can't know what changed while you were away. You need to know the current state before directing them.

---

#### **2. Provide Context to AI Agents**
**When:** Starting any task

**Bad:**
> "Fix the bug"

**Good:**
> "There's a bug where assessments aren't saving. According to SYSTEM_STATUS.md, we have two assessment systems (old `assessments` table and new `user_assessments` with AI). Let's investigate the new AI system first."

**Why:** AI agents work 10x better when you reference which systems are affected.

---

#### **3. Remind AI to Update Docs**
**When:** After deploying features or changing architecture

**Say:**
> "Great! Now update SYSTEM_STATUS.md and CHANGELOG.md with these changes."

**Why:** AI agents will do it, but they need the reminder. They don't know when a change is "significant enough" to document without you telling them.

---

#### **4. Verify Deployments**
**When:** After AI pushes to production

**Check:**
- ‚úÖ Vercel dashboard shows green deployment
- ‚úÖ Test the feature in production
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ Works on mobile

**Why:** AI agents can't access production. Only you can verify it actually works.

---

#### **5. Friday Health Check (15 minutes)**
**When:** Every Friday

**Do:**
```bash
# What changed this week?
cat CHANGELOG.md | head -50

# Are docs organized?
ls -1 *.md        # Should only show 5 files

# Is SYSTEM_STATUS.md current?
cat SYSTEM_STATUS.md | grep "Last Updated"
```

**Why:** Prevents documentation rot. 15 minutes/week keeps chaos away.

---

### **Important - Do When Relevant:**

#### **6. Make Business Decisions**
**Examples:**
- "Should we add this feature?"
- "Which option is better for users?"
- "Is this the right pricing?"
- "Should we prioritize X or Y?"

**Why:** AI agents can implement, but YOU decide what's best for the business.

---

#### **7. Approve Breaking Changes**
**Examples:**
- Changing database schema
- Removing features
- Changing API contracts
- Altering pricing/plans

**Why:** These affect users. AI agents should ask permission first.

---

#### **8. Review Major Changes**
**When:** AI implements large features

**Check:**
- Does this match what I wanted?
- Are there edge cases missed?
- Is the approach sound?
- Should we do it differently?

**Why:** AI agents are powerful but not perfect. Your review catches issues early.

## üìä **AUTOMATION MATRIX**

| Task | AI Automatically | You Must |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Follow coding standards** | ‚úÖ Yes | Review if concerned |
| **Create TODO lists** | ‚úÖ Yes (for complex tasks) | None |
| **Read SYSTEM_STATUS.md** | ‚ö†Ô∏è When referenced | ‚úÖ Every session start |
| **Implement features** | ‚úÖ Yes (with your direction) | Provide clear requirements |
| **Update documentation** | ‚ö†Ô∏è When reminded | ‚úÖ Remind them |
| **Run linter** | ‚úÖ Yes | None |
| **Write commit messages** | ‚úÖ Yes | None |
| **Push to GitHub** | ‚úÖ Yes | None |
| **Verify in production** | ‚ùå Can't | ‚úÖ Always verify |
| **Make business decisions** | ‚ùå Needs your input | ‚úÖ You decide |
| **Approve breaking changes** | ‚ùå Needs permission | ‚úÖ You approve |
| **Friday health check** | ‚ùå Can't remember | ‚úÖ Your calendar |

## üéØ **YOUR ESSENTIAL 3**

If you only remember 3 things:

### **1. Read SYSTEM_STATUS.md First (30 sec)**
```bash
cat SYSTEM_STATUS.md | head -50
```

### **2. Give AI Context (1 min)**
"Working on X feature. It affects Y and Z systems from SYSTEM_STATUS.md."

### **3. Remind AI to Update Docs (30 sec)**
"Update SYSTEM_STATUS.md and CHANGELOG.md with these changes."

**Total time: 2 minutes per session**  
**Value: Prevents hours of confusion**

## ü§ñ **HOW AI AGENTS WORK**

### **They Automatically:**
1. Read `.cursorrules` at the start of every conversation
2. Follow coding standards without being told
3. Create TODO lists for multi-step tasks
4. Follow DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md process
5. Test before deploying
6. Write descriptive commit messages

### **They Need You To:**
1. Tell them what to build
2. Reference SYSTEM_STATUS.md for context
3. Make business decisions
4. Remind them to update docs
5. Verify in production

### **They Can't:**
1. Know what changed while you were away
2. Access production to verify
3. Make business decisions
4. Remember to do Friday health checks
5. Know when a change is "significant enough" to document

---

## üí° **OPTIMAL WORKFLOW**

### **You:**
```
1. Read SYSTEM_STATUS.md (30 sec)
2. Tell AI what to build with context (1 min)
3. Review AI's plan and approve
```

### **AI Agent:**
```
1. Reads .cursorrules automatically
2. Creates TODO list
3. Reads relevant docs from SYSTEM_STATUS.md
4. Implements following standards
5. Tests thoroughly
6. Commits with good message
```

### **You:**
```
4. Remind AI: "Update SYSTEM_STATUS.md and CHANGELOG.md"
```

### **AI Agent:**
```
7. Updates documentation
8. Commits docs
9. Pushes to GitHub
```

### **You:**
```
5. Verify in production (2 min)
6. Confirm deployment succeeded
```

## üéâ **THE BOTTOM LINE**

### **AI Does 90% of Work:**
- All coding
- All testing
- All documentation writing
- All commits
- All deployments

### **You Do 10% of Critical Decisions:**
- What to build
- Business logic
- Approve breaking changes
- Verify production
- Keep system organized

### **Time Investment:**
- **Daily:** 2-3 minutes (read status, give context, remind docs)
- **Weekly:** 15 minutes (Friday health check)
- **Monthly:** 30 minutes (review and improve)

### **ROI:**
- **Without system:** Hours of confusion, duplicated work, broken features
- **With system:** Smooth development, clear state, AI agents work perfectly

**The system works if you do your 10%. AI handles the other 90%.**
