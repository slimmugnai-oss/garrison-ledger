## Top 10 Critical Career Guides

### 1. Warrant Officer Financial Path: Application to Retirement
**BLUF:** Warrant officers earn $4,500-8,000/mo (more than senior NCOs) with technical focus vs command stress. Application costs $500 (tests, packets), acceptance rate 30-50%. CW3 at 20 years = $5,000/mo pension vs E-8 = $3,000/mo. Career tradeoff: less promotion competition, more job satisfaction, better pay.

### 2. OCS/OTS Financial Planning: Enlisted to Officer Pay Changes  
**BLUF:** Commission from E-5 to O-1 = $500-800/mo pay increase immediately. Costs: uniform ($2,000), PCS to OCS ($3,000), opportunity cost (6-12 months training, no BAH if single). ROI: positive by year 2, massive by year 10 (O-3 earns $40K/year more than E-6).

### 3. Military to Civilian Transition: 180-Day Financial Timeline
**BLUF:** Transition from military to civilian career = 6-month income gap typical, cost $15K-25K (health insurance, job search, certifications). TAP program helps but start 12 months early. Save 12 months expenses, line up job BEFORE separating, utilize veteran hiring preferences, leverage security clearance ($10-30K salary bump).

### 4. Federal Job Application for Veterans: USAJOBS and Veterans Preference
**BLUF:** Federal jobs = pension, TSP, job security, GS-7 to GS-13 typical for veterans ($50-100K). Veterans preference gives hiring advantage. USAJOBS system is learnable. Resume must be federal format (verbose, not civilian concise). Security clearance = fast-track hire. Start applying 6 months before separation.

### 5. Military to Contractor: Clearance Value and Salary Expectations
**BLUF:** Military contractors earn $80-180K (vs $60-80K active duty equivalent). Security clearance = $10-30K salary premium. Deployment rotations (3 months on, 1 month off), overseas contracts (tax-free if 330 days/year), no pension but high income. Best for: 10-15 year separators who want contractor role until 50-60 then retire.

### 6. Palace Chase/Palace Front: Active Duty to Guard/Reserve Financial Analysis
**BLUF:** Palace Chase (early separation to Guard/Reserve) lets you separate before contract end AND keep benefits. Guard/Reserve = part-time income ($300-800/mo) + Tricare Reserve Select ($240/mo) + GI Bill + pension at 60. Works if: civilian job lined up, want more control of life, keeping 1 foot in military. Financial tradeoff: lose $30-50K/year active pay, gain flexibility.

### 7. Starting a Business After Military: VA Small Business Loans and Franchises
**BLUF:** VA backs small business loans (SBA 7(a) program) for veterans - lower down payment, better terms than civilian loans. Franchises give structure (McDonald's, UPS Store, lawn care) vs starting from scratch. Military skills transfer (leadership, logistics, discipline). Real earnings: $50-150K/year if business succeeds. Risk: 50% of businesses fail in 5 years.

### 8. Retirement at 20 vs 30 Years: Pension and Career Comparison
**BLUF:** Retire at 20 years = 50% pension (High-3) or 40% (BRS), age 38-42. Stay to 30 years = 75% pension, age 48-52. E-8 at 20 years = $3,200/mo, at 30 years = $4,800/mo. Extra 10 years = $1,600/mo more pension ($384K over 20-year retirement). Tradeoff: 10 more years of service vs $384K. Depends on job satisfaction and goals.

### 9. Reenlistment vs Separation Financial Analysis: The 10-Year Decision
**BLUF:** Separate at 10 years = no pension, no benefits, start civilian career at 28-32. Stay to 20 = pension, TRICARE for life, VA benefits. Financial difference: $500K-$1M lifetime (pension value). Separate only if: civilian career pays $80K+, hate military, family demands, health issues. Otherwise: grit through to 20 for pension.

### 10. Commission vs Enlisted Career Progression: Financial Comparison
**BLUF:** O-3 earns $40K/year more than E-6 at same time in service. But commissioning requires college degree (4 years, $30K+ cost), OCS (6-12 months training), and cultural shift (leadership vs technical). ROI: O-1 to O-5 (20 years) = $2M total earnings vs E-1 to E-7 = $1.4M. Commission pays better but requires degree investment upfront.
