## üìù NOTES

### **Architecture Decisions:**
1. **Tab-based interfaces**: Chose tabs over separate pages for related calculators to reduce navigation complexity
2. **Real-time calculations**: No "Calculate" button needed - results update as users type
3. **Kept external resource links**: Deployment guide and other content-heavy pages remain external (not tools)
4. **Color coding**: Blue for existing financial tools, green for new planning tools

### **Future Enhancements:**
- [ ] Add save/export functionality to calculators
- [ ] Integrate with user profile (pre-fill data from assessments)
- [ ] Add comparison views (e.g., compare multiple job offers)
- [ ] Email calculator results to users
- [ ] Add calculator result sharing features
