# üöÄ GARRISON LEDGER - COMPLETE REBUILD PLAN

**Decision Made:** Option A - Do it right  
**Timeline:** 3 weeks  
**Goal:** Premium, $29.99-worthy product  
**Current Price:** $9.99 (massive value gap)

---

## **üìä CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT**

### **Strengths:**
‚úÖ Pro infrastructure (Vercel + Supabase Pro)  
‚úÖ Solid rules engine (100% tested)  
‚úÖ Working payment system  
‚úÖ 5 comprehensive toolkit pages  
‚úÖ Clean, professional UI  

### **Weaknesses:**
‚ùå Only 19 atomic blocks (should be 100+)  
‚ùå Thin plans (feels basic)  
‚ùå Generic AI integration (marketing fluff)  
‚ùå Surface-level assessment data  
‚ùå Dashboard is placeholder-quality  
‚ùå Plan presentation is boring  

**Verdict:** Good foundation, weak execution. Needs complete content & personalization rebuild.

## **üéØ 3-WEEK REBUILD ROADMAP**

---

## **WEEK 1: CONTENT EXPLOSION & RICH PROFILING**

### **Phase 1A: Deep Content Extraction** (Days 1-3, 12-15 hours)

**Objective:** Extract 100-150 atomic blocks from 5 toolkits

**Deliverables:**

**1. Extraction Script** (`scripts/extract-deep-content.ts`)
- Parse all 5 HTML toolkit files
- Identify content boundaries (h2, h3 sections)
- Extract: headline, body HTML, lists, tables, callouts
- Auto-classify by type (guide, checklist, calculator, FAQ, case-study, pro-tip)
- Generate summaries (first 150 chars or meta description)
- Auto-tag with keywords

**2. Taxonomy System**
```typescript
type ContentBlock = {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  summary: string;
  html: string;
  
  // Classification
  domain: 'pcs' | 'career' | 'deployment' | 'finance' | 'base-life';
  category: 'planning' | 'execution' | 'optimization' | 'crisis' | 'transition';
  type: 'guide' | 'checklist' | 'calculator' | 'faq' | 'pro-tip' | 'case-study';
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  
  // Metadata for AI scoring
  target_rank?: 'enlisted' | 'officer' | 'all';
  target_family?: 'single' | 'married' | 'kids' | 'all';
  target_timeline?: 'immediate' | 'planning' | 'long-term';
  urgency_keywords: string[]; // 'orders', 'deployment', 'crisis', etc.
  
  // Engagement
  est_read_min: number;
  related_blocks: string[]; // Slugs of related content
  topics: string[];
  tags: string[];
  
  // Admin
  source_page: string;
  source_section: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
};
```

**3. Content Enrichment**
- Review extracted blocks
- Add missing metadata
- Write better summaries where auto-generation failed
- Connect related blocks
- Set difficulty levels

**Expected Output:**
- **PCS Hub:** 20-25 blocks (timeline, budget, housing, OCONUS, emotional, FAQ, PPM, etc.)
- **Career Hub:** 20-25 blocks (TSP, MyCAA, portable careers, federal jobs, resume, entrepreneurship, etc.)
- **Deployment:** 15-20 blocks (pre-deployment, SDP, family pact, reintegration, FAQ, etc.)
- **Shopping:** 10-15 blocks (commissary, exchange, OCONUS, calculators, pro-tips, etc.)
- **Base Guides:** 15-20 blocks (housing, schools, EFMP, local resources, etc.)

**TOTAL: 100-125 atomic blocks**

---

### **Phase 1B: Rich User Profiling** (Days 4-5, 8-10 hours)

**Objective:** Collect deep user data for true personalization

**Deliverables:**

**1. Database Schema** (`supabase-migrations/04_user_profiles.sql`)
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (

  bah_amount INT,
  housing_situation TEXT, -- on-base, rent-off-base, own
  
  -- Goals & Interests
  long_term_goal TEXT, -- retire-military, transition-soon, unsure
  career_interests TEXT[], -- federal, entrepreneur, remote, education

  -- Preferences
  content_difficulty_pref TEXT DEFAULT 'all', -- beginner, intermediate, advanced, all
  urgency_level TEXT DEFAULT 'normal',
  
  -- System
  profile_completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),

);
```

**2. Profile Setup Flow** (`/dashboard/profile/setup`)
- New user onboarding (15 questions)
- Clean, step-by-step UI
- Progress indicator
- Skip options for sensitive data
- **Makes assessment shorter (10 questions vs 30)**

- All 100+ content blocks with metadata
- Current date & military calendar context

**GPT-4o Prompt Structure:**
```
You are a senior military life strategist creating a personalized roadmap.

USER PROFILE:
Rank: E-5, 6 years service
Branch: Army
Base: Fort Liberty
Family: Married, kids ages 3 and 6
PCS: In 8 weeks to JBLM
Deployment: Pre-deployment (4 months out)
Career: Interested in federal employment + entrepreneurship
Finance: $18K debt, $5K emergency fund, $52K TSP
Housing: Currently renting, BAH $2,100
Goals: Retire military, build wealth

AVAILABLE CONTENT (125 blocks):
[Complete list with metadata]

YOUR TASK:
1. Identify their top 3 strategic priorities
2. Select 8-10 most relevant blocks across all priorities
3. Write 250-word executive summary explaining their situation and strategy
4. Write section introductions for each domain represented
5. For each block, write 2-3 sentence SPECIFIC reasoning (reference their actual data)
6. Create 5-7 "immediate action" checklist items
7. Write 1-paragraph conclusion with encouragement

OUTPUT (JSON):
{
  executiveSummary: "As an E-5 at 6 years with young kids (3 and 6), you're facing a complex 8-week window: simultaneous PCS to JBLM and deployment prep. Your \$18K debt and modest emergency fund make this high-stakes. Here's your strategic roadmap: (1) PCS execution with kids' school enrollment, (2) Deployment financial/legal prep, (3) Long-term: transition planning using your federal employment interest. Your TSP is solid at \$52K‚Äîprotect it while tackling debt during deployment's boosted income.",
  
  priorities: [
    { domain: "pcs", title: "Critical: 8-Week PCS Execution", urgency: "immediate", blocks: 4 },
    { domain: "deployment", title: "High: 4-Month Deployment Prep", urgency: "high", blocks: 3 },
    { domain: "career", title: "Medium: Federal Employment Prep", urgency: "planning", blocks: 2 }
  ],
  
  sections: [
    {
      domain: "pcs",
      title: "Your 8-Week PCS Battle Plan",
      intro: "With orders to JBLM and kids ages 3 and 6, you have exactly 8 weeks to coordinate school enrollment (kindergarten for the 6-year-old starts late August), arrange childcare for the 3-year-old, and execute the physical move. Your \$2,100 BAH at JBLM is \$300 less than Fort Liberty, so housing budget needs adjustment.",
      blocks: [
        {
          slug: "pcs-master-checklist",
          reasoning: "Your 6-year-old needs to be enrolled in JBLM schools by mid-August‚Äîmissing the deadline could mean homeschooling until January. This checklist's school section includes the exact documents JBLM requires (immunization records, proof of residence, previous school transcripts). Do this in Week 1.",
          priority_label: "DO FIRST - WEEK 1",
          order: 1
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ],
  
  immediateActions: [
    "Monday: Call JBLM school district (253-xxx-xxxx) to start kindergarten enrollment for your 6-year-old",
    "This week: Schedule TMO for household goods pickup (aim for 6 weeks before report date)",
    "Week 1: Get POA and wills notarized (deployment requirement, prevents legal emergencies)",
    "Week 2: Set up SDP at 60% of base pay to max \$10K cap during deployment",
    "Week 3: Research JBLM childcare options for your 3-year-old (waitlists are 2-3 months)"
  ],
  
  conclusion: "You're managing three major life events simultaneously (PCS + deployment + young family), which is legitimately challenging. But you have a clear plan now. Focus on the 8-week PCS execution first, layer in deployment prep during weeks 3-6, and use the deployment itself as focused time to research your federal employment transition. Your 6 years of experience positions you well for GS-7/9 federal roles‚Äîstart browsing USAJobs for JBLM positions NOW so you can network during the PCS."
