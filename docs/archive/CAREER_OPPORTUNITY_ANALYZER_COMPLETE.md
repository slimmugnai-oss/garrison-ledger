## 🎯 Initiative 2: Holistic "Analyzer" Transformation - COMPLETE

### New Compensation Fields Added:

#### For Both Current & New Scenarios:
1. **Annual Bonus**
   - Optional field for performance bonuses, signing bonuses, etc.
   - Adds directly to total compensation

2. **Retirement Match (%)**
   - Input as percentage (e.g., 5% for typical 401k match)
   - Calculates dollar value: `salary × (match% / 100)`
   - Displays calculated value below input field

3. **State Income Tax (%)**
   - Critical for comparing offers across states
   - Examples provided: CA ~9%, NY ~7%, TX/FL/WA 0%
   - Factors into after-tax income calculation

### Advanced Calculations Implemented:

1. **Total Annual Compensation**
   ```
   Total Comp = Base Salary + Bonus + Retirement Match Value
   ```

2. **After-Tax Income**
   ```
   After-Tax = Total Comp × (1 - Federal Tax - State Tax)
   Federal Tax: 15% (simplified effective rate)
   State Tax: User-provided percentage
   ```

3. **Cost of Living Adjustment**
   ```
   Adjusted New Offer = New After-Tax × (Current COL / New COL)
   ```

4. **Net Financial Difference**
   ```
   Net Difference = Adjusted New Offer - Current After-Tax
   ```
