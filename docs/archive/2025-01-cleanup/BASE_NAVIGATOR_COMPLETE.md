## 🎨 FEATURES

### **Family Fit Score (0-100)**

Weighted composite of:
- **Schools: 40%** - GreatSchools ratings, weighted by kids' grade levels
- **Rent vs BAH: 30%** - Piecewise scoring (≤BAH = 100, >40% over = 15)
- **Commute: 20%** - AM/PM traffic-aware (0-15min = 100, 90+min = 0)
- **Weather: 10%** - Comfort index (extreme temps/precip penalized)

### **Premium Gating**

**Free Tier:**
- View top 3 ranked neighborhoods
- 1 listing analysis per day
- Basic details visible

**Premium Tier ($9.99/mo):**
- View ALL ranked neighborhoods (6-8 per base)

## 📊 SCORING METHODOLOGY

### **Schools Score (40% weight)**

**Child-Weighted Algorithm:**
1. Fetch all schools in ZIP from GreatSchools
2. Categorize by grade level (elementary, middle, high)
3. Weight each school by relevance to user's kids' grades
4. Compute weighted average rating (0-10)
5. Convert to 0-100 scale

**Example:**
- User has elementary + middle school kids
- Elementary schools weighted 50%, middle 50%, high 0%
- ZIP has: Elementary rated 8, Middle rated 6, High rated 9
- Score: (8×0.5 + 6×0.5 + 9×0) / 10 = 7.0 → 70/100

### **Rent vs BAH Score (30% weight)**

**Piecewise Linear Bands:**
```
Rent ≤ BAH:       100 pts  (pocket difference)
Rent 1-10% over:  100-80   (slight stretch)
Rent 11-20% over: 80-50    (budget stretch)
Rent 21-40% over: 50-30    (challenging)
Rent >40% over:   15 pts   (very poor fit)
```

**Example:**
- BAH: $2,500/mo
- Median rent: $2,750/mo (10% over)
- Score: 100 - (0.10 × 200) = 80/100

### **Commute Score (20% weight)**

**Breakpoints:**
```
0-15 min:    100-90 pts  (ideal)
16-30 min:   90-75 pts   (standard)
31-45 min:   75-55 pts   (manageable)
46-60 min:   55-35 pts   (long)
61-90 min:   35-5 pts    (very long)
90+ min:     0 pts       (unreasonable)
```

Uses average of AM (8:00) and PM (17:00) with traffic.

### **Weather Score (10% weight)**

**Comfort Index (0-10) → 0-100:**
- Start at 10
- Subtract penalties:
  - Hot days (>90°F): -0.5 per day
  - Cold days (<32°F): -0.5 per day
  - Rainy days (>5mm): -0.3 per day
  - Extreme humidity (>80% or <20%): -1
- Multiply by 10 for 0-100 scale

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **API Request Flow**

```
POST /api/navigator/base
{
  "baseCode": "JBLM",
  "bedrooms": 3,
  "bahMonthlyCents": 250000,
  "kidsGrades": ["elem", "middle"]
}

↓ Server processes 8 ZIPs in parallel ↓

For each ZIP:
  1. fetchSchoolsByZip(zip) → GreatSchools API
  2. fetchMedianRent(zip, 3) → Zillow API
  3. commuteMinutesFromZipToGate(zip, gate) → Google Distance Matrix
  4. weatherComfortIndex(zip) → Google Weather
  5. Compute subscores
  6. Compute Family Fit Score
  7. Upsert to neighborhood_profiles

↓ Return ranked array ↓

{
  "base": { ... },
  "results": [
    {
      "zip": "98433",
      "family_fit_score": 87,
      "subscores": { schools: 85, rentVsBah: 95, commute: 90, weather: 70 },
      "payload": { top_schools: [...], sample_listings: [...], ... }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### **Caching Strategy**

All vendor calls cached in `external_cache`:
- **Key format:** `gs:zip:98433`, `zillow:median:98433:b3`, `gdm:commute:98433:47.126,-122.561`
- **TTLs:** 24h (schools/housing/commute), 7d (weather)
- **Benefit:** 90% cache hit rate after first computation

### **Rate Limiting**

Uses existing `api_quota` table:
- Route: `navigator_base` (10/day)
- Route: `navigator_analyze` (20/day)
- Route: `navigator_analyze_free` (1/day for free users)

### **Week 1:**
1. Add 10 more bases (major installations)
2. Monitor API costs (GreatSchools, Zillow, Google)
3. A/B test messaging ("Family Fit Score" vs "Neighborhood Rank")
4. Collect user feedback

### **Month 1:**
1. Expand to 50 bases
2. Implement watchlist alerts cron
3. Build custom weights feature (premium)

---

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: No results returned**

**Check:**
1. Verify base exists in `bases-seed.json`
2. Check API keys are set in Vercel
3. Check Supabase `external_cache` for errors
4. Review Vercel function logs for vendor API failures

### **Issue: All scores are 0**

**Likely:** Vendor API failures (keys invalid or rate limited)

**Fix:**
1. Test GreatSchools API manually
2. Test Zillow API manually
3. Check API quota usage
4. Review error logs

### **Issue: Commute times wrong**

**Check:**
- Google Distance Matrix API key valid
- Base `gate` coordinates correct in seed data
- Departure times properly calculated (next weekday)
