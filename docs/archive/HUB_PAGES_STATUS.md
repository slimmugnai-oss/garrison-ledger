# ðŸš€ HUB PAGES MIGRATION STATUS

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Decision:** Host all 5 hub pages on `app.familymedia.com` (full control)  
**Reason:** DA 21 = minimal SEO difference (2-3%), control advantage wins

---

## âœ… **COMPLETED**

### **1. PCS Hub** 
**URL:** `app.familymedia.com/pcs-hub`  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE - Production ready  
**File:** `app/(hubs)/pcs-hub/page.tsx`

**Includes:**
- Complete PCS timeline (6 months to arrival)
- Budget planning with typical expenses
- On-base vs. off-base vs. buying comparison
- OCONUS moving guide
- 3 integrated CTAs (Assessment, House Hacking Calculator, Readiness Widget)
- Full SEO optimization
- Mobile responsive

---

## ðŸ”¨ **NEXT STEPS**

### **Option A: I Complete All 5 Pages Now**
I can build the remaining 4 hub pages using the same high-quality approach:
- Career Hub (TSP, MyCAA, portable careers, federal employment)
- Deployment Guide (SDP, financial prep, reintegration)
- On-Base Shopping (Commissary, Exchange, OCONUS shopping)
- Base Guides (Housing decisions, orientation, resources)

**Time needed:** ~30 minutes
**Result:** All 5 hub pages ready to go live

### **Option B: You Copy Existing Content + Add CTAs**
Since you control the content on Danny's site:
1. Copy the HTML content from each existing hub page
2. Paste into the page structure I created for PCS Hub
3. Add the relevant CTAs from `/toolkit-integration/` files

**Time needed:** ~2 hours (you doing it)
**Result:** Same outcome, you have more control over exact content

## ðŸ“‹ **FOR DANNY: REDIRECT SETUP**

Once all hub pages are live on your app, send this to Danny:

```
Hi Danny,

We're migrating the 5 toolkit hub pages to app.familymedia.com for faster updates and better integration with our premium tools.

Can you please add these 5 redirects to familymedia.com's vercel.json?

{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/pcs-hub",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/pcs-hub",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/career-hub",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/career-hub",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/deployment",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/deployment",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/on-base-shopping",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/on-base-shopping",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/base-guides",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/base-guides",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}

These are 301 (permanent) redirects, so Google will pass SEO value to the new locations within 2-4 weeks.

Thanks!
```
