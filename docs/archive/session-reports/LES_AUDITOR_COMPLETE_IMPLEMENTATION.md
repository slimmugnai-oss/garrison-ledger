## üèóÔ∏è Total Validation Coverage

**Items Validated:** **17 line items**
- 9 Entitlements

## üí∞ What Users Can Now Do

### Primary Use Case: "Why is my net pay wrong?"

**Before (Partial Auditor):**
- User: "My BAH and BAS are correct, but I'm still $500 short!"
- Auditor: "Sorry, I only check allowances."
- User: üòû

**After (Complete Auditor):**
- User enters full LES (entitlements + deductions + taxes + net pay)
- Auditor calculates expected net pay
- Auditor flags: "TSP over-withheld by $200 + SGLI double-charged $300 = $500 short"
- User: "Found it! Contacting finance now." üòä

### Secondary Use Cases

**1. TSP Contribution Verification**
- User configures: 5% TSP contribution
- Auditor auto-fills expected TSP based on gross √ó 5%
- Flags if actual TSP doesn't match

**2. SGLI Premium Check**
- User configures: $400K SGLI coverage
- Auditor looks up premium from sgli_rates table
- Flags if wrong premium amount charged

**3. Tax Withholding Accuracy**
- User configures: Single, Texas resident, 0 allowances
- Auditor estimates federal tax (IRS tables)
- Shows state tax = $0 (Texas has no income tax)
- Validates FICA (6.2%) and Medicare (1.45%)
- Flags if withholding is significantly off

**4. Complete Pay Verification**
- User wants peace of mind
- Enters entire LES in 5 minutes
- Gets comprehensive validation of all 17 items

## üîç Validation Logic

### Entitlements Validation
- Compares actual vs expected for each allowance
- Flags missing allowances (red)
- Flags mismatched amounts > threshold (red/yellow)
- Confirms correct values (green)

### Deductions Validation
- Verifies TSP contribution matches configured %
- Validates SGLI premium against rate table
- Checks dental premium if enrolled
- Flags over/under-withholding

### Taxes Validation  
- Verifies FICA at 6.2% (with wage base limit)
- Verifies Medicare at 1.45%
- Estimates federal tax and flags major variances
- Checks state tax (0 for no-tax states)

### Net Pay Validation (THE MONEY QUESTION)
- Calculates: Expected = Gross - Deductions - Taxes
- Compares: Expected vs Actual from LES
- Flags if delta > $50
- Tells user exactly why net pay is different

---

## üéì Tax Calculation Approach

### Why Estimates for Taxes

**Federal & State Tax:**
- Complex (brackets, deductions, withholding tables)
- Varies by W-4 settings
- Changes based on YTD earnings

**Our Approach:**
- Calculate **rough estimate** based on filing status and gross
- Auto-fill this estimate with green badge
- User **overrides with actual** value from LES
- We flag if actual is **significantly different** from estimate
- Clear messaging: "Tax is estimated - verify with actual LES value"

**FICA & Medicare:**
- **Exact calculation** (6.2% and 1.45%)
- No ambiguity
- Can validate precisely
