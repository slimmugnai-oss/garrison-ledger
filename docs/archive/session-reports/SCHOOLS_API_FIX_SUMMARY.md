# üîß Base Navigator Schools API - Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Issue:** School ratings not displaying in Base Navigator  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Code fixed, environment configuration needed

---

## üìä What Was The Problem?

**Root Cause:** The schools API integration code was correct, but when the `GREAT_SCHOOLS_API_KEY` environment variable is missing or invalid, the system silently returns empty arrays. This made it impossible to diagnose the issue.

**Symptoms:**
- "No school data" message in Base Navigator results
- Schools subscore showing but no actual school names/ratings
- No clear error message for developers or users

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed?

### **1. Enhanced Logging (`lib/navigator/schools.ts`)**

**Before:**
```typescript
if (!apiKey) {
  console.warn('[Schools] GreatSchools API key not configured');
  return [];
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (!apiKey) {
  console.warn('[Schools] ‚ö†Ô∏è GreatSchools API key not configured - set GREAT_SCHOOLS_API_KEY in Vercel');
  console.warn('[Schools] School ratings will not be available. See docs/active/BASE_NAVIGATOR_API_SETUP.md');
  return [];
}

// Added detailed error logging for API failures:
if (response.status === 410) {
  console.error('[Schools] 410 Error = v1 API deprecated. You need v2 API key from GreatSchools');
} else if (response.status === 401) {
  console.error('[Schools] 401 Unauthorized = Invalid or expired API key');
}

// Added success logging:
console.log(`[Schools] ‚úÖ Fetched ${schools.length} schools for ZIP ${zip}`);
if (schools.length > 0) {
  console.log(`[Schools] Top school: ${schools[0].name} (${schools[0].rating}/10)`);
}
```

**Impact:** Server logs now clearly show what's wrong (missing key, wrong version, invalid key, etc.)

---

### **2. Better User-Facing Messages (`BaseNavigatorClient.tsx`)**

**Before:**
```typescript
{result.payload.top_schools.length > 0 ? (
  // Show schools
) : (
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">No school data</p>
)}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{result.payload.top_schools.length > 0 ? (
  // Show schools with ratings
) : isPremium ? (
  <div className="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded p-2">
    <p className="text-xs text-yellow-800">
      <strong>API Configuration Needed:</strong> School ratings require GreatSchools API key.
      Check server logs for details.
    </p>
  </div>
) : (
  <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded p-2">
    <p className="text-xs text-blue-800">
      <a href="/dashboard/upgrade" className="underline">Upgrade to Premium</a>
      to see school ratings from GreatSchools
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

**Impact:**
- **Premium users** see clear message that API needs configuration
- **Free users** see upgrade CTA (proper product messaging)
- No more generic "No school data" confusion

### **3. Comprehensive Documentation**

**Created:**
- ‚úÖ `docs/active/BASE_NAVIGATOR_SCHOOLS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Complete diagnostic guide
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `docs/active/BASE_NAVIGATOR_API_SETUP.md` - Setup instructions

**Updated:**
- ‚úÖ `lib/navigator/schools.ts` - Better logging and error handling

## üöÄ What You Need To Do Now

### **Quick Fix (3 steps, ~5 minutes):**

1. **Get GreatSchools v2 API Key:**
   - Visit: https://www.greatschools.org/api/
   - Sign up (free for basic tier)
   - Request v2 API key (instant approval)
   - Check email for key

2. **Add to Vercel:**
   - Go to Vercel project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add new variable:
     - **Name:** `GREAT_SCHOOLS_API_KEY`
     - **Value:** Your API key (paste exactly, no quotes)
     - **Environments:** All (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click Save

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
   - Wait ~2 minutes
   - Test Base Navigator

---

## üß™ How To Verify It's Working

### **After redeploying, check:**

1. **Vercel Function Logs:**
   - Go to Deployments ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí `/api/navigator/base`
   - Look for:
     ```
     [Schools] Fetching schools for ZIP 98498...
     [Schools] ‚úÖ Fetched 15 schools for ZIP 98498
     [Schools] Top school: Lincoln Elementary (9/10)
     ```

2. **Base Navigator UI:**
   - Visit `/dashboard/navigator`
   - Select a base
   - Click "Find Best Neighborhoods"
   - In results, "Top Schools" section should show:
     - School names (e.g., "Lincoln Elementary")
     - Ratings (e.g., "9/10")
     - No yellow warning box

3. **Schools Subscore:**
   - Should be contributing to Family Fit Score (40% weight)
   - Subscore should show actual value (not 0)

## üîç Debugging Guide

**If schools still don't show after adding API key:**

‚Üí See: [`docs/active/BASE_NAVIGATOR_SCHOOLS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](docs/active/BASE_NAVIGATOR_SCHOOLS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

**Common issues:**
- ‚ùå Using v1 API key (deprecated) ‚Üí Request v2 key
- ‚ùå Typo in API key ‚Üí Copy carefully
- ‚ùå Forgot to redeploy ‚Üí Redeploy after adding env var
- ‚ùå API key not approved for endpoint ‚Üí Contact GreatSchools support

**Quick test:**
```bash
# Test your API key works
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://api.greatschools.org/nearby-schools?zip=98498&limit=5"

# Should return JSON with schools array (not 410 or 401 error)
```

## üìä Expected Behavior After Fix

### **Premium Users:**
- See full neighborhood rankings
- "Top Schools" section shows 2-3 schools with names and ratings
- Schools contribute 40% to Family Fit Score
- Can filter by kids' grade levels (elementary/middle/high)

### **Free Users:**
- See limited preview (3 neighborhoods)
- "Top Schools" section shows blue "Upgrade to Premium" message
- Don't see actual school data (premium-gated)

### **Schools Subscore:**
- 0-100 scale (converted from 0-10 GreatSchools rating)
- Child-weighted (if user selects "Elementary", elementary schools weighted more)
- Cached for 24 hours per ZIP
- Falls back to 0 if no data (doesn't break ranking)

## üéØ Next Steps

**Immediate (Required):**
- [ ] Get GreatSchools v2 API key
- [ ] Add `GREAT_SCHOOLS_API_KEY` to Vercel
- [ ] Redeploy application
- [ ] Test in production
- [ ] Verify Vercel logs show success

**Soon (Recommended):**
- [ ] Also configure `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` (weather data)
- [ ] Verify `RAPIDAPI_KEY` is set (housing data)
- [ ] Full Base Navigator test with all APIs working
- [ ] Update SYSTEM_STATUS.md with configuration status

**Later (Optional):**
- [ ] Monitor GreatSchools API usage (rate limits)
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerts for API failures
- [ ] Consider alternative school data providers as backup

---

## üí° Why This Issue Existed

**Original Implementation:**
- Code was correct (API integration worked)
- Silent failure mode (returned empty array when key missing)
- No clear diagnostic messaging
- Hard to distinguish between "no schools in area" vs "API not configured"

**Now Fixed:**
- Clear server-side logging (shows exactly what's wrong)
- User-facing messages (premium users know to check logs)
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- Easy to diagnose and fix

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

**What happened:** Schools API integration was coded correctly but silently failing due to missing environment variable.

**What was fixed:** Added extensive logging, better error messages, user-facing diagnostics, and comprehensive documentation.

**What you need to do:** Get GreatSchools v2 API key, add to Vercel env vars, redeploy.

**Time to fix:** ~5 minutes (API key signup + Vercel configuration + redeploy)

**Documentation:**
- **Troubleshooting:** `docs/active/BASE_NAVIGATOR_SCHOOLS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- **Setup Guide:** `docs/active/BASE_NAVIGATOR_API_SETUP.md`
