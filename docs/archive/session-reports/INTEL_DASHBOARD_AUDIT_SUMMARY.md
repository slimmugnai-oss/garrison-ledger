## ðŸ”§ WHAT WAS FIXED

### Critical Fix #1: Incorrect BAH MHA Codes
**File:** `content/finance/bah-basics.mdx`

**Problem:**  
Used invalid MHA codes (WA408, CA917) that don't exist in `bah_rates` table â†’ would show "Data unavailable" errors.

**Solution:**  
Updated to correct codes:
- `WA408` â†’ `WA311` (Tacoma/JBLM) - displays $2,850/month
- `CA917` â†’ `CA038` (San Diego) - displays $4,395/month

**Status:** âœ… **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

## ðŸ’¡ INSIGHTS & OBSERVATIONS

### Strengths
1. **Solid Architecture:** MDX + Server Components = clean data fetching
2. **Good Separation:** Data providers isolated, easy to test/maintain
3. **Comprehensive:** All military pay data types covered (BAH/BAS/TSP/COLA/etc.)
4. **User-Friendly:** Clear disclaimers, provenance, formatting

### Opportunities
1. Add more Intel cards (only 13 currently, room for 50+)
2. Consider adding related card suggestions at bottom
3. Add bookmarking/favorites feature
4. Track popular cards via analytics

---

## ðŸ“ž SUPPORT & MAINTENANCE

**Monitoring:**
- Check Vercel logs after deployment
- Monitor for "Data unavailable" errors (indicates provider issues)
- Track usage analytics (which cards most viewed)

**Updating Data:**
- BAH: Update annually (January) - re-import CSV
- BAS: Update `ssot.ts` manually
- TSP/IRS: Update `admin_constants` table
- COLA: Quarterly updates to COLA tables

**Adding New Cards:**
1. Create `.mdx` file in `/content/{domain}/`
2. Add frontmatter (id, title, domain, tags, gating)
3. Use `<Disclaimer>`, `<RateBadge>`, `<DataRef>` as needed
4. Build and deploy (auto-generates route)
