### Phase 2: Critical Bug Fixes ✅
- **Fixed:** Field mapping in `app/api/les/audit-manual/route.ts`

## 🔒 Security Status

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: RLS Migration Required

**Issue:** Current RLS policies use `auth.role()` instead of `auth.uid()::text = user_id`

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- Requires authenticated user (good)
- Does NOT validate user_id ownership (BAD)
- Potential for cross-user data access

**Fix Available:** 
- File: `supabase-migrations/20251020_les_auditor_rls_fix.sql`
- Guide: `scripts/apply-les-rls-migration.md`
- Verification queries included
- Rollback procedure documented

**Next Step:** Apply migration via Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
