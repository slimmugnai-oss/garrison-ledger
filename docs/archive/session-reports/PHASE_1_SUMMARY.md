4. **RAG Retrieval System**
   - Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
   - Content-type filtering
   - Similarity scoring
   - Performance monitoring

5. **Data Freshness Tracker**

## Architecture

### Current Flow (Before RAG)

```
User asks question
  ↓
Extract entities (rank, base)
  ↓
Query DB tables (BAH, pay, TSP)
  ↓
Inject into Gemini prompt
  ↓
Generate answer (limited context)
```

### New Flow (With RAG)

```
User asks question
  ↓
Extract entities (rank, base, topic)
  ↓
[NEW] Generate query embedding
  ↓
[NEW] Vector search (retrieve relevant chunks)
  ↓
[NEW] Keyword search (fallback)
  ↓
[NEW] Merge & deduplicate results
  ↓
Query DB tables (BAH, pay, TSP)
  ↓
Inject official data + RAG chunks into prompt
  ↓
Generate answer (10x richer context)
```

**Impact:** Answers will include context from 410 curated articles + official data
