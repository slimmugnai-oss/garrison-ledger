## 💬 EXAMPLE ONBOARDING MESSAGE

**When starting with a new AI agent, copy-paste this:**

```
Hi! I'm working on Garrison Ledger, a military financial intelligence platform.

Quick context:
• Sitemap: 32 pages across 9 categories (tracked in admin)
• Database: 32 tables (5 user, 8 admin, 11 tools, 13 data, 4 analytics)
• Admin Dashboard: 6 tabs with complete operational intelligence
• Data Sources: 4 subsystems (LES Auditor, Base Navigator, PCS Copilot, Content)

Reference docs (read in order):
1. docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md - One-page cheat sheet
2. docs/AI_AGENT_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md - Complete platform reference
3. docs/PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md - Visual architecture diagrams
4. SYSTEM_STATUS.md - Current system state

Admin dashboard has everything:
• Tab 6 (Sitemap): All 32 pages with health monitoring
• Tab 5 (Ops Status): All data sources with freshness tracking
• Tab 3 (Personnel): User management
• Tab 2 (Intel): Analytics (revenue, engagement, tools)

Key principle: Military audience = no-BS, direct, 100% accurate data only.

Let's start. [Your question/task here]
