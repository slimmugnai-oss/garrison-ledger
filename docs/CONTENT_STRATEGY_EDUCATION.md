## Top 10 Critical Education Guides

### 1. GI Bill Comparison: Post-9/11 vs Montgomery vs Transfer to Dependents (EXPANDED)
**BLUF:** Post-9/11 GI Bill = best for most (full tuition + housing allowance). Transfer to dependents requires 4-year commitment AND must do before year 16 of service. Missing transfer window = lose $100K+ in education value for kids. Montgomery GI Bill = legacy (rarely better than Post-9/11).

### 2. Tuition Assistance (TA) Maximization: $4,500/Year Free College
**BLUF:** Every branch offers Tuition Assistance: $4,500/year (Army/Navy/AF), $4,000 (Marines) for active duty education. Covers: tuition only (not books/fees). Use TA during active duty, save GI Bill for after separation or transfer to kids. TA + CLEP = bachelor's degree for FREE while active duty.

### 3. Military Spouse Education Benefits: MyCAA Deep Dive
**BLUF:** MyCAA (Military Spouse Career Advancement Accounts) = $4,000 for spouse education/certifications. Eligibility: E-1 to E-5, W-1 to W-2, O-1 to O-2 spouses. Covers: associate degrees, certifications (medical assistant, coding bootcamp, HVAC). Use it: free money, no payback required. Apply early (funding limited).

### 4. CLEP/DSST Testing: Earning College Credits for $89
**BLUF:** CLEP (College Level Examination Program) lets you test out of college classes for $89 per test (vs $1,500 per class). Military pays CLEP fees (DANTES funding). Study free (Modern States, Khan Academy), test on base (testing center), earn 3-6 credits per test. Smart E-5 can earn entire associate degree via CLEP + TA = $0 cost.

### 5. Credentialing Assistance by Branch: Free Professional Certifications
**BLUF:** Each branch offers credentialing assistance: $4,000/year (Army CA), $4,500 (Navy COOL), $4,000 (AF COOL) for professional certifications (IT, medical, trades). Stack with GI Bill and TA. Example: use CA for CompTIA Security+ ($400), CISSP ($700), PMP ($550) = career boost + salary increase ($10-20K).

### 6. College Selection for Military Families: Transfer Credits and Online Options
**BLUF:** Pick transfer-friendly schools (accept max CLEP/military credits). Best for military: UMUC, AMU, Penn State World Campus, Arizona State Online (military-friendly, accept transfers, online options). Avoid: schools that don't accept transfer credits (lose 30-60 credits = $15-30K wasted).

### 7. Student Loan Repayment Programs: SLRP vs GI Bill Trade-Offs
**BLUF:** Army SLRP (Student Loan Repayment Program) pays up to $65,000 of student loans BUT you must give up GI Bill. Bad trade for most - GI Bill worth $100K+. Only take SLRP if: loans are massive ($80K+), don't plan to use college, can pay off loans faster than earning degree.

### 8. Using GI Bill for Graduate School: MBA, Law School, Medical School
**BLUF:** GI Bill covers graduate school too (36 months total). MBA at state school = $40K covered. Law school = $100K+ covered. Medical school = 36 months worth (may need loans for years 3-4). Yellow Ribbon schools waive tuition above GI Bill cap = attend private school for free.

### 9. Spouse College During Active Duty: Balancing Family, Work, and School
**BLUF:** Military spouse pursuing degree while servicemember active duty = challenging (PCS disrupts school, kids need care, deployment solo parenting). Strategies: online degrees (AMU, UMUC, ASU), part-time enrollment, use MyCAA + TA, budget for childcare ($800-1,500/mo), plan 4-6 year degree timeline (not 4 years due to PCS).

### 10. Free Military Education Resources: DANTES, Sophia, Modern States
**BLUF:** Free education resources: Modern States (free CLEP prep + $89 test fee waiver), Sophia ($99/mo unlimited college credits), DANTES (free testing), Khan Academy (free everything). Smart strategy: Sophia for easy credits ($99/mo for 6 months = $594 for 30 credits worth $15,000).
