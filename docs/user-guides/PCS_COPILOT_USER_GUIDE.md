## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. TLE Days Exceeded

**Mistake:** Entering more than 10 days at one location.

**Why it matters:** Only 10 days reimbursable per location.

**Fix:** Split excess days into house hunting trip if authorized.

### 2. Missing PCS Orders Date

**Mistake:** Forgetting to enter orders date.

**Why it matters:** Required for all claims!

**Fix:** Check your orders and enter the date issued.

### 3. Lodging Rate Too High

**Mistake:** Claiming more than locality maximum.

**Why it matters:** Excess won't be reimbursed.

**Fix:** Check DTMO per diem rates for your location.

### 4. No Weigh Tickets for PPM

**Mistake:** Doing PPM move without weigh tickets.

**Why it matters:** REQUIRED for payment!

**Fix:** Get empty and full weight tickets before you move.

### 5. Receipts Not Itemized

**Mistake:** Losing receipts or getting non-itemized ones.

**Why it matters:** Finance requires itemized receipts for TLE.

**Fix:** Always ask for itemized receipts and save them!

### AI Explanations

**For Every Validation Issue:**
- Why it's flagged
- JTR rule citation
- How to fix it
- What to do next

**Example:**
> ⚠️ **Warning:** TLE at origin exceeds 10 days
