## Move Types

### What's the difference between DITY, Full Move, and Partial DITY?

**DITY (Do-It-Yourself) Move / PPM (Personally Procured Move):**
- You handle the entire move yourself
- Rent truck, pack, load, drive, unload
- Government reimburses you based on weight × distance
- **Potential profit:** Often $2,000-$5,000
- **Best for:** Lighter loads (under 8,000 lbs), organized people

**Full Move (Government Contracted):**
- Government hires moving company
- They pack, load, transport, deliver
- You pay nothing (government covers cost)
- **Potential profit:** None
- **Best for:** Heavy loads (over 12,000 lbs), busy schedules, OCONUS moves

**Partial DITY:**
- Split between DITY and Full Move
- Example: DITY your car and essentials, government moves furniture
- Get reimbursed for portion you moved
- **Potential profit:** Moderate ($1,000-$3,000)
- **Best for:** Medium loads, want some profit but not all the work

### How do I know which move type to choose?
Use our **Cost Comparison Tool** (`/dashboard/pcs-copilot/comparison`) to compare all three options side-by-side with your specific weight, distance, and rank. We'll show you potential profit/cost for each option.

## Entitlements & Calculations

### What is DLA (Dislocation Allowance)?
DLA is a one-time payment to help cover costs of relocating your household. Amount depends on:
- Your rank (E-1 through O-10)
- Whether you have dependents
- Typical amounts: $2,000-$4,000

DLA is **automatic** - you don't need receipts. It's paid directly to you.

### What is MALT (Mileage Allowance in Lieu of Transportation)?
MALT is reimbursement for driving your personal vehicle(s) to your new duty station.
- **2025 rate:** $0.22 per mile
- Calculated by shortest distance between duty stations
- Can claim for up to 2 vehicles
- **Example:** 1,000-mile move = $220 per vehicle

### What is Per Diem?
Per Diem is a daily allowance for meals and incidental expenses during travel.
- **2025 rate:** Varies by location ($100-$200+ per day)
- Covers you AND dependents
- Calculated by authorized travel days
- **Note:** If you stay at lodging with included meals, per diem may be reduced

### What is TLE (Temporary Lodging Expense)?
TLE reimburses hotel costs if you can't immediately move into your new residence.
- **Max duration:** 10 days at origin + 10 days at destination
- Covers actual lodging costs up to locality cap
- Must provide receipts
- **Pro tip:** Use TLE strategically for house hunting

### What are Weight Allowances?
Weight allowances are the maximum amount of household goods (HHG) the government will move for free.
- Varies by rank and dependent status
- **E-5 example:** 7,000 lbs (no deps) / 9,000 lbs (with deps)
- **O-3 example:** 11,000 lbs (no deps) / 13,000 lbs (with deps)
- Includes 2,000 lbs pro-gear (work equipment)
- **Over weight?** You pay for excess out of pocket

## DITY/PPM Moves

### How much can I make on a DITY move?
Profit varies based on several factors:
- **Weight:** Heavier loads = more reimbursement
- **Distance:** Longer moves = more reimbursement
- **Efficiency:** Lower actual costs = more profit

**Typical profit range:** $2,000-$5,000
**Sweet spot:** 5,000-8,000 lbs over 500-2,000 miles

Our Cost Comparison Tool shows your estimated profit.

### What's the government reimbursement formula?
The government pays you a percentage of what they would have paid a moving company. Formula:
1. Government calculates cost to hire moving company
2. You get paid **95%** of that amount (keep 95%, government saves 5%)
3. Your profit = Reimbursement - Your Actual Costs

**Example:**
- Government cost: $5,000
- You get paid: $4,750 (95%)
- Your actual costs: $2,500 (truck, gas, hotel)
- **Your profit:** $2,250

### Do I need weigh tickets?
**YES!** For DITY moves, weigh tickets are **mandatory**. You need:
- **Empty weight:** Weigh your truck/trailer BEFORE loading
- **Full weight:** Weigh AFTER loading
- Must use certified scale (CAT scales, public scales)
- Keep both tickets - you'll submit for reimbursement

**Pro tip:** Many truck stops have CAT scales. Use the Weigh My Truck app to find nearby scales.

### What receipts should I keep for DITY?
Keep **EVERY** receipt. These are 100% reimbursable:
- ✅ Truck rental
- ✅ Gas (all fuel for towing vehicle)
- ✅ Hotels/lodging during travel
- ✅ Tolls
- ✅ Packing materials (boxes, tape, bubble wrap)
- ✅ Equipment rental (dollies, furniture pads)
- ✅ Storage (if temporary)
- ✅ Meals during travel days (per diem rules)

**More receipts = more reimbursement!**

## Document Upload & OCR

### What is OCR and how does it work?
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) automatically reads text from your uploaded documents:
1. You upload a photo/PDF of your PCS orders
2. Our AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash Vision) extracts key data
3. Auto-populates fields like dates, bases, weight allowances
4. You review and confirm extracted data

**Accuracy:** Typically 85-95% accurate (always review extracted data)

### What document types can I upload?
- **PCS Orders** (most important)
- **Weigh Tickets** (empty and full)
- **Lodging Receipts**
- **Fuel Receipts**
- **Meal Receipts**
- **Other Documents** (rental agreements, storage, etc.)

**Supported formats:** JPEG, PNG, WebP, PDF (max 10MB)

### What if OCR misreads my document?
No problem! OCR is a time-saver, not a replacement for your review:
1. Check extracted data carefully
2. Correct any errors manually
3. All data is editable
4. Confidence scores show OCR reliability

## Assignment Planner (Pre-Orders)

### What is the Assignment Planner?
The Assignment Planner helps you compare potential duty stations **before** you get orders:
- Compare 2-5 bases side-by-side
- See BAH rates, cost of living, school ratings
- Estimate PCS costs for each option
- Save comparisons for future reference

**Use case:** When you're told "you're going to either Fort Hood, Fort Bragg, or Fort Campbell" but haven't received official orders yet.

### How accurate are base comparisons?
- **BAH rates:** Official DFAS data (current fiscal year)
- **Cost of living:** Based on national index
- **School ratings:** GreatSchools.org data
- **PCS costs:** Estimated based on distance and typical moving costs

**Note:** These are planning tools. Actual orders may differ.

## Claims Library & History

### How do I view past PCS claims?
Go to **Claims Library** (`/dashboard/pcs-copilot/library`):
- Timeline view: Chronological display

### Can I export my claim history?

### How does the Claims Library help with taxes?
PCS moves have tax implications:

- **Out-of-pocket expenses:** May be deductible (Form 3903)
- **DITY profit:** May be taxable income

Our Claims Library tracks all expenses and reimbursements, making tax time easier.

## Cost Comparison Tool

### What does the Cost Comparison Tool show?
Side-by-side analysis of three move options:
1. **DITY Move:** Your potential profit
2. **Full Government Move:** Total cost to government
3. **Partial DITY:** Hybrid approach savings

For each option, we show:
- Total costs
- Reimbursements
- Net profit/loss
- Recommendations

### How do I use the Cost Comparison Tool?
1. Enter basic move details (weight, distance, dates)
2. Enter estimated costs for DITY (truck, gas, etc.)
3. Click "Calculate Comparison"
4. Review results and our recommendation
5. Save comparison for reference

**Pro tip:** Run multiple scenarios (conservative, aggressive) to understand your range.

### What's the "break-even" weight?
Break-even weight is where DITY and Full Move cost the same:
- **Below break-even:** DITY is profitable
- **Above break-even:** Full Move is cheaper

**Example:** If break-even is 10,000 lbs and you have 7,000 lbs, DITY is likely best.
