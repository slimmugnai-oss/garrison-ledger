## 1. Military Marriage Financial Planning: Joint Finances from Day One

### BLUF
Military marriages have 60% higher divorce rate than civilian (source: DoD). Financial stress is #1 cause. Solution: joint bank account, shared budget, monthly money meetings, and financial transparency. Set up correctly from week 1: joint checking for bills, individual "fun money" accounts, emergency fund, TSP beneficiaries updated. Financial teamwork = stronger marriage.

### Key Sections

**Why Military Marriages Are Financially Different**
- Deployment income changes (HFP/IDP add $225-450/mo, CZTE makes income tax-free)
- Frequent PCS moves (spouse career disruption, moving costs)
- BAH dependency changes (marriage = BAH increase of $500-800/mo)
- Dual-military scenarios (double income, double complexity)
- Young marriage (average military marriage age 23 vs civilian 28)
- Financial immaturity (E-3 marrying E-3, both with debt, managing $80K household income)

**Joint vs Separate Accounts Debate**
**Best Practice: Hybrid Approach**
- Joint checking: all income → joint account, pay all bills from here
- Individual "fun money": each spouse gets $100-300/mo for personal spending
- Joint savings: emergency fund, house down payment, PCS buffer
- Individual retirement: each has own TSP (but coordinate strategy)

**Why This Works:**
- Transparency: both see all money coming in and going out
- Autonomy: each has guilt-free spending money
- Goals: shared savings for family priorities
- Simplicity: one account for bills, automatic payments

**Setting Up Joint Finances (Week 1 Checklist)**
- [ ] Open joint checking account at military bank (USAA, Navy Fed)
- [ ] Direct deposit both paychecks to joint account
- [ ] Set up individual "fun money" accounts ($200/mo each)
- [ ] List all debts (student loans, car, credit cards)
- [ ] Create joint budget (rent, food, utilities, savings, fun)
- [ ] Update SGLI beneficiaries (spouse primary, kids contingent)
- [ ] Update TSP beneficiaries (spouse gets 100%)
- [ ] Discuss financial goals (debt-free by when, house, kids, retirement)

**Monthly Money Meeting**
- Schedule: 1st of every month, 30-60 minutes
- Review: spending vs budget, progress on goals, upcoming expenses
- Adjust: modify budget if needed, discuss big purchases
- Celebrate: wins (paid off debt, hit savings milestone)
- Plan: next month's irregular expenses (car insurance, gifts, trips)

**Common Money Fights and Solutions**
- Fight: "You spent $300 on [hobby] without telling me!"
  - Solution: each spouse gets $200 fun money, no questions asked
- Fight: "We never have money for anything fun"
  - Solution: budget for fun (date nights, travel, hobbies)
- Fight: "You're always deploying, I manage money alone"
  - Solution: deployment financial plan, monthly check-ins, shared Mint/YNAB
- Fight: "Your debt is dragging us down"
  - Solution: joint debt payoff plan, celebrate progress together

**Beneficiary Updates After Marriage**
- SGLI: update immediately (spouse primary, not parents)
- TSP: update spouse as beneficiary (separate from SGLI!)
- DEERS: enroll spouse within 90 days (gets ID card, TRICARE)
- Insurance: auto, renters, life insurance add spouse
- Will: create or update (Legal Assistance Office free)

**Prenup Considerations**
- When prenup makes sense: prior assets ($50K+), prior marriage, military retirement already vested
- What to protect: pre-marriage TSP, inheritance, rental properties
- Military pension: 10/10 rule (married 10 years + 10 years service = spouse entitled to direct payment)
- Cost: $500-2,000 for attorney, worth it for complex situations
- Conversation: have it BEFORE engagement, not week before wedding

**Financial Red Flags Before Marriage**
- Secret debt (find out early)
- Vastly different money values (spender vs saver extremes)
- Unwilling to discuss finances (avoidance, defensiveness)
- Financial infidelity (hidden accounts, secret spending)
- Dependence on parents for money (not financially independent)

**Real Examples:**
- E-5 marries E-4, both have $15K debt
- Week 1: open joint account, combine debt into shared payoff plan
- Strategy: debt avalanche on highest interest ($8K credit card first)
- Timeline: debt-free in 24 months with $1,000/mo payments
- Marriage survives because finances were transparent from start

**Verification Checklist**
- [ ] Open joint checking account
- [ ] Update SGLI and TSP beneficiaries
- [ ] Enroll spouse in DEERS (within 90 days)
- [ ] Create joint budget
- [ ] Schedule monthly money meetings
- [ ] Update will and estate plan
- [ ] Discuss financial goals and values

**Tool Handoffs**
- Newlywed Budget Planner
- Joint Debt Payoff Calculator
- BAH Impact Calculator (single to married)

**Real Example:**
- E-3 marries civilian, BAH jumps from $1,200 (without deps) to $1,800 (with deps)
- Extra income: $600/mo = $7,200/year
- Joint budget: use entire $600/mo for debt payoff
- Pay off $10K credit card in 18 months
- Build $5K emergency fund months 19-24
- Start TSP contributions month 25 (5% match)
- Year 3: debt-free, emergency funded, saving for house

## 2. Divorce in the Military: Financial Implications and BAH Changes

### BLUF
Military divorce rate: 3-4% annually (10-year marriage = 30-40% divorce rate). Financial impacts: lose dependents BAH ($500-800/mo drop), split TSP/assets, possible spousal support, lose commissary/base access (spouse). 10/10 rule: married 10 years + 10 years of service during marriage = ex-spouse entitled to portion of pension (paid directly from DFAS). Get military divorce attorney who knows 10/10 rule, USFSPA, and SCRA.

### Key Sections

**Financial Impact of Military Divorce**
- BAH drops to without-dependents rate (lose $500-800/mo)
  - E-6 with deps: $1,900/mo → without deps: $1,300/mo = -$600/mo
  - O-4 with deps: $2,400/mo → without deps: $1,800/mo = -$600/mo
- Child support payments (if have kids)
- Spousal support/alimony (if marriage 10+ years)
- Legal fees ($3,000-15,000 depending on complexity)
- Split assets (house, cars, TSP, savings)
- Loss of family benefits (spouse loses ID, TRICARE, commissary)

**10/10/10 Rule for Military Pension Division**
- Married 10+ years
- Servicemember served 10+ years during marriage
- Divorce grants ex-spouse up to 50% of pension (typically 20-40%)
- Ex-spouse gets direct payment from DFAS (not dependent on servicemember)

**Example:**
- O-4 with 18 years service, married for 12 years, divorcing
- Pension formula: 12 years married ÷ 18 years service = 67% of marriage during service
- Ex-spouse entitled to portion: typically 33% of pension (half of 67%)
- Projected pension: $4,000/mo
- Ex-spouse gets: $1,320/mo
- Servicemember keeps: $2,680/mo

**USFSPA (Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act)**
- Federal law governing military divorce
- Allows state courts to divide military pension
- Caps ex-spouse portion at 50% of disposable retired pay
- Direct payment through DFAS if 10/10/10 rule met
- Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) can be required for ex-spouse

**Child Support and Custody**
- Calculate using state formulas (varies by state)
- Military pay counts as income for calculation
- BAH and BAS usually counted (not just base pay)
- Deployment doesn't stop child support (must keep paying)
- Custody challenges with PCS (can servicemember PCS with kids? court decides)

**Dividing Assets**
- House: sell and split proceeds, or one buys out other
- TSP: divide via Retirement Benefits Court Order (RBCO)
  - Can split TSP without tax penalty during divorce
  - Ex-spouse gets portion transferred to their IRA
  - Example: $300K TSP, court awards 40% to spouse = $120K transferred
- Cars: typically one car to each spouse
- Debt: usually split equally (or kept by whoever incurred it)
- Savings: split per court order

**BAH with Dependents After Divorce**
- If have primary custody of kids: keep BAH with dependents
- If no kids or no custody: drop to BAH without dependents
- If split custody (kids 50/50): court decides who claims dependents rate
- Update DEERS immediately after divorce (remove ex-spouse)

**Legal Assistance Office Services**
- Free legal advice on divorce (but cannot represent you in court)
- Free document review (separation agreements, child support)
- Referrals to civilian divorce attorneys
- Deployment protection info

**Finding Military Divorce Attorney**
- Need: attorney who knows 10/10/10, USFSPA, SCRA, and local state law
- Cost: $3,000-15,000 (varies by state and complexity)
- Worth it: protect pension, TSP, custody rights
- Cheap divorce ($500 online) = mistakes that cost $50K-100K long-term

**SCRA Protections During Deployment**
- Divorce cannot proceed if servicemember deployed (automatic stay)
- Must respond within 90 days of return
- Spouse cannot get default judgment while deployed

**Financial Recovery After Divorce**
- Rebuild emergency fund (lost in asset split)
- Update budget (new BAH rate, child support payments)
- Max TSP (rebuild retirement savings)
- Update beneficiaries (SGLI, TSP to kids or parents)
- Update will and estate plan
- Focus on financial stability for kids

**Real Examples:**
- E-7 divorces after 15-year marriage, 18 years of service
- Ex-spouse awarded 35% of pension = $875/mo from his $2,500 pension
- He keeps: $1,625/mo pension, $350K TSP (split $200K to her)
- Child support: $1,200/mo for 2 kids
- Total outflow: $875 pension + $1,200 child support = $2,075/mo
- Financial recovery: rebuilds TSP, focuses on kids, debt-free, remarries at 45

**Verification Checklist**
- [ ] Consult military divorce attorney (knows 10/10/10 rule)
- [ ] Understand pension division (calculate potential impact)
- [ ] Update DEERS after divorce (remove ex-spouse)
- [ ] Update beneficiaries (SGLI, TSP)
- [ ] Modify budget for new BAH rate and child support
- [ ] Rebuild emergency fund

## 3. Military Spouse Career Planning: Portable Careers and Remote Work

### BLUF
Military spouse unemployment rate: 21% (vs 4% civilian). PCS every 2-3 years kills careers. Solution: portable careers (remote work, federal jobs, teaching, nursing, certifications). Remote tech job = $50-80K income that follows every PCS. Teaching license transfers some states. RN license compact = work in 36 states. Plan career portability from engagement.

### Key Sections

**Why Military Spouse Employment Is Hard**
- PCS every 2-3 years = leave job, start over
- Certifications don't transfer (teaching, cosmetology, real estate vary by state)
- Gaps in resume (employers see job-hopping)
- Childcare challenges (CDC waitlists, no family support nearby)
- Deployment solo parenting (can't work full-time while spouse deployed)
- Location limitations (rural bases = limited job market)

**Portable Career Paths**

**1. Remote Work (Best Option)**
- Tech: software engineer, UX designer, data analyst ($60-120K)
- Writing: technical writer, content manager, copywriter ($45-75K)
- Marketing: digital marketing, SEO, social media manager ($50-80K)
- Customer service: remote support, account management ($35-55K)
- Virtual assistant: admin, bookkeeping, project management ($30-50K)
- Teaching: online ESL (VIPKid, QKids), tutoring ($20-40K)

**Advantages:**
- Income follows every PCS (no job loss)
- Work from anywhere (base, OCONUS, home)
- Flexible hours (adapt to military schedule)
- Build skills and resume continuously

**2. Federal Employment (Best Stability)**
- Federal jobs: follow to every base (internal transfers)
- Veterans preference: spouses get hiring preference too
- Pay: GS-5 to GS-12 typical ($35-85K)
- Benefits: pension, TSP, health insurance
- Locations: federal jobs at most military installations
- USAJOBS: search "military spouse preference"

**3. Healthcare (Always In-Demand)**
- Registered Nurse (RN): Nursing License Compact = work in 36 states
- LPN/LVN: shorter training, still portable
- Dental hygienist: in demand, license transfers some states
- Physical therapist: license varies, but demand high
- Medical assistant: certification transfers easily
- Pay: RN $60-90K, LPN $40-55K, medical assistant $30-45K

**4. Education (Portable with Caveats)**
- Teaching license: varies by state (some reciprocity, some require re-certification)
- Substitute teaching: easier to break into, flexible hours
- DODEA schools: prefer military spouses, transfer worldwide
- Private schools: less restrictive on certifications
- Tutoring: always in demand, can be side hustle
- Pay: $40-65K (teachers), $25-40K (substitute)

**5. Certifications and Portable Professions**
- Real estate: license by state, but can study for new state during PCS
- Cosmetology: license by state, many require re-licensing

**Example: E-5 with working spouse**
- Servicemember income: $55,000
- Spouse remote work: $60,000
- **Household income: $115,000**
- Compared to single income: $60K more = $5,000/mo extra
- Use for: max both TSPs ($47K/year), pay off debt, save for house, build wealth

**Spouse Employment and PCS**
- Best: remote work (keep job through PCS)
- Good: federal job (transfer to new base)
- Challenging: local civilian job (quit and restart each PCS)

**Childcare Coordination**
- Remote work + flexible hours = work during school hours
- CDC or off-base daycare ($800-1,500/mo)
- Family (if nearby) = free childcare
- Deployment solo parenting: may need to quit job or go part-time

**Tax Benefits of Spouse Employment**

  - B) Transition to remote teaching/tutoring ($35K) = portable
- Chooses B: online ESL teaching + tutoring
- Income: $35K (vs $50K teaching), but keeps job through next 3 PCS
- 10-year career: remote work = $350K total, teaching = $200K (due to job gaps)
- Remote work wins long-term

## 3. Pre-Deployment Relationship Strengthening: Financial and Emotional Prep

### BLUF
Deployment will test your relationship - 6-12 months apart, financial stress, communication challenges, fidelity concerns. Pre-deployment relationship prep: weekly date nights (reconnect before separation), deployment budget agreement, set communication expectations, address money and fidelity openly. Couples who prepare have 70% lower deployment divorce rate than those who don't.

### Key Sections

**60-Day Pre-Deployment Relationship Checklist**
- Week 1-2: Talk about fears (money, fidelity, kids, safety)
- Week 3-4: Create deployment financial plan (budget, POA, allotments)
- Week 5-6: Set communication expectations (FaceTime frequency, email, letters)
- Week 7-8: Finish legal tasks (will, POA, SGLI beneficiaries)
- Week 9-10: Connect spouse to FRG and support network
- Week 11-12: Maximize time together (date nights, family time, no distractions)

**Deployment Financial Planning for Couples**
- Allotments: automatic payments for rent, car, insurance, savings
- Joint account: spouse has full access (remove any financial barriers)
- Budget agreement: spouse authorized spending limits ($500+, discuss first)
- Emergency fund: $5,000-10,000 accessible to spouse
- POA: power of attorney for spouse (bank, legal, healthcare)
- Deployment income increase: HFP $225/mo, CZTE (tax-free), save 50%+

**Communication Expectations**
- Frequency: FaceTime 2-3x/week (if internet available), daily text/email
- Topics: kids, money, daily life, emotional check-ins
- Avoid: constant complaining, criticizing, fighting via text
- Time zones: coordinate schedule (deployed to Afghanistan = 9.5 hour difference)
- Blackout periods: communication stops during missions (don't panic)

**Fidelity and Trust**
- Address it: don't avoid the topic, talk about temptations
- Boundaries: agree on opposite-sex friendships, going out, social media
- Accountability: check in daily, share location (not controlling, but trust-building)
- Statistics: deployment infidelity happens (10-15% of servicemembers, 20-25% of spouses)
- Prevention: transparency, communication, strong relationship before deployment

**R&R (Rest and Recuperation) Planning**
- Timing: usually mid-deployment (2 weeks leave)
- Location: servicemember flies home vs meet at vacation spot
- Cost: government pays flights home, you pay if meet elsewhere
- Use it: reconnect, have fun, avoid fighting about deployment stuff
- Don't expect: perfection - R&R is bittersweet (reconnect then separate again)

**Homecoming Preparation**
- Expect: adjustment period (2-3 months)
- Common issues: servicemember wants control back, spouse has established routines
- Financial handoff: spouse managed money solo, now back to joint decisions
- Intimacy: takes time to rebuild (be patient)
- Kids: may be closer to spouse (deployed parent feels left out)

**Deployment Relationship Killers**
- Financial secrets (spouse hides spending, servicemember gambles)
- Poor communication (weeks without contact, defensive during calls)
- Infidelity (obvious)
- Lack of trust (constant suspicion, controlling behavior)
- No support system (spouse isolated, no friends, no FRG)

**Deployment Relationship Strengtheners**
- Daily contact (even 5-minute FaceTime)
- Shared goals (save $20K during deployment, buy house after)
- Care packages (mail letters, photos, favorite snacks)
- Support network (FRG, friends, family)
- Trust (assume positive intent, don't manufacture drama)

**FRG (Family Readiness Group)**
- Unit spouses support group
- Benefits: information, social support, kids' activities, emergency help
- Drawbacks: drama (sometimes), gossip
- Strategy: engage moderately, build 2-3 close friendships

**Real Examples:**
- E-6 deploys to Afghanistan for 9 months
- Pre-deployment: weekly date nights, discussed fidelity, set budget, POA signed
- During deployment: FaceTime 3x/week, spouse saves $25K, no fights
- Homecoming: 2-month adjustment, but marriage solid
- Post-deployment: uses $25K for house down payment, marriage stronger

**Verification Checklist**
- [ ] Have honest conversation about deployment fears
- [ ] Create deployment financial plan and budget
- [ ] Set communication frequency expectations
- [ ] Discuss fidelity and boundaries
- [ ] Connect spouse to FRG and support network
- [ ] Max pre-deployment time together
- [ ] Complete legal tasks (POA, will, beneficiaries)
