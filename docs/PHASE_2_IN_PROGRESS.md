## 🔨 REMAINING WORK (3-4 hours)

### **STEP 3: Integrate RAG into Ask API** (2 hours)
**File:** `app/api/ask/submit/route.ts`

**Changes needed:**
1. Import RAG retrieval engine
2. Add RAG retrieval step after data query
3. Pass RAG chunks to AI prompt
4. Update AI prompt to use RAG context
5. Format response with source citations

**Key functions to add:**
```typescript
// 1. Retrieve RAG chunks
const ragChunks = await hybridSearch(question, {
  content_types: ['premium_guide', 'jtr_rule'],
  limit: 5
});

// 2. Build enhanced prompt with RAG context
const prompt = buildMilitaryExpertPrompt(
  question,
  profileData,
  officialData,
  ragChunks,  // NEW!
  'advisory'
);

// 3. Format response with citations
const response = {
  ...aiResponse,
  citations: [
    ...ragChunks.map(chunk => ({
      title: chunk.metadata.guide_title,
      url: `/knowledge/${chunk.content_id}`,
      type: 'knowledge_base'
    }))
  ]
};
```

### **STEP 4: Build Military Expert Prompt** (1 hour)
**File:** `lib/ask/prompts/military-expert-prompt.ts` (NEW)

**Create comprehensive system prompt:**
- Military expert persona (20-year NCO + CFP + military spouse)
- BLUF-style answer format
- Profile personalization instructions
- RAG context injection
- Source citation requirements
- JSON response format

### **STEP 5: Test & Deploy** (1 hour)
**Test questions:**
1. "How does SDP work?" (should use premium guide)
2. "What's my BAH as an E-5 at Fort Hood?" (should use official data + profile)
3. "Should I live on-base or off-base?" (should use premium guide + advisory)
4. "How do I maximize DITY move profit?" (should use premium guide)
5. "What's TSP allocation for a 35-year-old?" (should use premium guide)

**Deploy:**
1. Commit changes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel auto-deploys
4. Test in production
5. Monitor first 20 questions

## 🎯 NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

**Right now, you need to:**

1. **Integrate RAG into Ask API** (`app/api/ask/submit/route.ts`)
   - Add `import { hybridSearch } from '@/lib/rag/retrieval-engine';`
   - Call `hybridSearch()` after data query step
   - Pass `ragChunks` to AI prompt
   - Include citations in response

2. **Create Military Expert Prompt** (`lib/ask/prompts/military-expert-prompt.ts`)
   - Build comprehensive system prompt
   - Inject RAG context
   - Define JSON response format
   - Add BLUF requirements

3. **Test with 5 Questions**
   - Test SDP question → verify it uses premium guide
   - Test BAH question → verify it uses official data
   - Test advisory question → verify it combines sources
   - Check response format
   - Verify citations appear

4. **Deploy**
   - Commit: "feat: integrate RAG into Ask Assistant"
   - Push to GitHub
   - Verify Vercel deployment
   - Test in production

## 💡 WHY THIS MATTERS

### **Before RAG:**
**User:** "How does SDP work?"  
**AI:** "SDP is a savings program for deployed service members. Check with your finance office." ❌

### **After RAG:**
**User:** "How does SDP work?"  
**AI:** "BLUF: SDP lets you deposit up to $10,000 during deployment and earn 10% guaranteed interest compounded quarterly. As an E-5 deployed to Kuwait for 12 months, if you max it out on Day 1, you'll earn ~$1,291 in free money. 

Here's your strategy:
1. Get DD Form 2558 from finance within 30 days
2. Set up $2,500/month allotment × 4 months = $10,000
3. Combine with CZTE (your combat pay is tax-free, so SDP returns are too)
