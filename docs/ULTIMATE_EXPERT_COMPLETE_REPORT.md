AI: "BAH is Basic Allowance for Housing... [comprehensive answer]

**PROACTIVE INSIGHTS:**

- 🚨 **Red Flag:** Your marriage status in DEERS may not match reality. Verify to ensure correct BAH rate.

**SUGGESTED FOLLOW-UPS:**

- "Can I lose my BAH?"

**RECOMMENDED TOOLS:**
- 🧮 Base Navigator - Compare housing costs at your location
