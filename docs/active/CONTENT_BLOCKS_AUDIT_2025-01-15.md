## ⚠️ **ISSUES FOUND & FIXED**

### **Issue 1: Bibliography Blocks Incorrectly Rated** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- 2 "Works cited" blocks had ratings of 4.5 and 4.0
- These are bibliographies/references, not user content
- Were being included in top 189 blocks for AI Curator
- Could be selected by AI and shown to users

**Impact:**
- 🟡 Medium - AI might select bibliography instead of useful content
- 🟡 Medium - Poor user experience if bibliography shown

**Solution:**
```sql
UPDATE content_blocks
SET 
  content_rating = 0.0,
  block_type = 'reference'
WHERE title = 'Works cited';
```

**Result:**
- ✅ 2 blocks now rated 0.0 (excluded from AI)
- ✅ Block type changed to 'reference'
- ✅ AI Curator now uses 187 blocks (down from 189)
- ✅ Bibliography blocks won't be shown to users

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

### **Issue 2: Generic Titles** (Non-Critical)

**Found:**
- 1 block titled "Conclusion" (about federal employment)
- Content is actually standalone and useful
- Not a problem, just flagged for awareness

**Action:** No action needed (content is good)
