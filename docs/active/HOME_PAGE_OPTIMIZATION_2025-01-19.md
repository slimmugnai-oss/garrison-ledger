## 🎯 **WHAT WAS OPTIMIZED:**

### **1. Military Audience Filter Applied**

**Removed AI Buzzwords** (per `.cursorrules` military audience filter):
- ❌ "AI-Powered Financial Planning" → ✅ "Military Financial Intelligence Platform"
- ❌ "AI analyzes your profile" → ✅ "Get your personalized plan curated for your rank, situation, and goals"
- ❌ "AI selects 8-10 expert content blocks" → ✅ "Receive 8-10 expert content blocks curated for your situation"
- ❌ "AI will analyze" → ✅ "Get 8-10 expert content blocks"
- ❌ "AI-powered planning" → ✅ "personalized financial intelligence"
- ❌ "AI-Curated Plan" → ✅ "Personalized Action Plan"

**Why:** Military families value proven results over buzzwords. Focus on outcomes, not technology.
