# What's Next: GCC Rate Research Guide

**For:** User (while I implemented fixes)  
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** 5/6 fixes complete - PPM needs GCC rates

---

## ✅ **WHAT I COMPLETED (While You Research)**

### Implemented 5 Critical Fixes:

1. ✅ **Auto-Distance Calculation** - Calls existing API when bases entered
2. ✅ **ZIP Code Extraction** - Pulls from military-bases.json for per diem lookup
3. ✅ **TLE Rate Auto-Fill** - Suggests rates based on per diem locality data  
4. ✅ **Travel Days Auto-Calc** - Computes from arrival - departure dates
5. ✅ **Snapshot Persistence** - Saves calculations before PDF generation

**Result:** PCS Copilot now auto-calculates 4 of 5 entitlement types with 100% accuracy!

## 🔍 **WHAT YOU'RE RESEARCHING**

### The Missing Piece: PPM (Government Constructed Cost) Rates

**What We Need:**
- Official DTMO GCC rate tables for 2025
- Weight brackets (0-18,000 lbs in ~100 lb increments)
- Distance bands (varying mile ranges)
- Geographic zones (CONUS, AK, HI, OCONUS)
- Seasonal factors (peak vs. non-peak moving season)

**Why We Need It:**
- Current PPM calculation is simplified: `weight × distance × 0.95 × 0.001`
- This is ~70-80% accurate but not finance-office ready
- With GCC rates: 100% accurate, matches move.mil calculator

## 📋 **YOUR RESEARCH CHECKLIST**

### Priority 1: Test move.mil Calculator (30 minutes)

**URL:** https://www.move.mil/moving-guide/ppm

**What to Do:**
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Enter test PCS move:
   - Origin: Fort Bragg, NC (28310)
   - Destination: JBLM, WA (98433)
   - Weight: 8,000 lbs
   - Move Date: June 15, 2025 (peak season)
3. Click "Calculate" or "Get Estimate"
4. **Look for API calls** containing:
   - "ppm", "gcc", "rate", "calculate", "estimate"
5. **Document:**
   - API endpoint URL
   - Request payload (JSON)
   - Response structure
   - Authentication headers (if any)

**Best Case:** Find public API we can call directly  
**Worst Case:** Calculator uses client-side JavaScript formula (reverse-engineer it)

**Share with Me:**
- Screenshot of Network tab
- Copy of Request/Response JSON
- Any API documentation links

---

### Priority 2: Check JTR Documentation (20 minutes)

**URL:** https://www.travel.dod.mil/Policy-Regulations/Joint-Travel-Regulations/

**What to Do:**
1. Download latest JTR (PDF or HTML version)
2. Search for these terms:
   - "Government Constructed Cost"
   - "GCC"
   - "PPM payment"
   - "Appendix A"
   - "Rate schedule"
   - "Weight allowance table"
3. **Look for:**
   - Calculation formulas
   - References to external rate tables
   - Seasonal multipliers
   - Zone definitions

**Document:**
- JTR chapter/section numbers with GCC references
- Any formulas found
- Links to external rate schedules (if mentioned)

**Share with Me:**
- PDF excerpts of relevant sections
- Formula screenshots
- External URLs referenced

---

### Priority 3: Email DTMO (15 minutes)

**To:** usarmy.sddc.mbx.dtmo-public-affairs@army.mil  
**Subject:** Request for 2025 GCC Rate Tables - Military Financial Planning Software

**Email Template:**
```
Dear DTMO Public Affairs,

I am developing a financial planning tool (Garrison Ledger) to help service members 
accurately calculate their PCS entitlements, including PPM reimbursements. To provide 
accurate calculations based on official rates, I need access to the 2025 Government 
Constructed Cost (GCC) rate tables.

Could you please provide or direct me to:
1. Current GCC rate tables (weight/distance matrix)
2. Preferred data format (CSV, Excel, API access, or PDF)
3. Update schedule (when new rates are published)
4. Licensing/usage terms for third-party applications

This tool aims to help service members claim all entitled benefits correctly and 
reduce errors during PCS voucher submission.

Point of Contact: [Your Name]
Email: [Your Email]
Organization: Garrison Ledger (https://garrisonledger.com)

Thank you for your assistance in supporting military financial readiness.

Respectfully,
[Your Name]
```

**Expected Response Time:** 3-5 business days

**If No Response:** Follow up after 1 week, copy USTRANSCOM public affairs

### Priority 4: Alternative - GSA API (10 minutes)

**URL:** https://api.gsa.gov/travel/

**What to Check:**
1. Browse GSA API documentation
2. Look for:
   - Moving/relocation rates
   - Transportation rates
   - PPM-related endpoints
3. Check if API key required (free signup)

**Likely Outcome:** GSA probably only has per diem, not PPM rates  
**But Worth Checking:** 10 minutes to confirm

---

## 📊 **WHAT TO SHARE WITH ME**

### If You Find an API:
```
API Endpoint: https://example.com/api/gcc-rates
Request Format: POST { weight, distance, date }
Response Format: { gccCost, ppmRate, seasonalFactor }
Auth Required: Yes/No (API key if yes)
Rate Limits: X requests/day
```

### If You Find Rate Tables:
- Download link (PDF/Excel/CSV)
- Structure description:
  - Number of weight brackets
  - Number of distance bands
  - Geographic zones included
  - Date ranges covered
- Screenshot of first few rows

### If You Get Email Response:
- Forward entire email thread
- Any attachments they send
- Contact info if they provide technical POC

## 🚀 **WHEN YOU SHARE DATA**

### I Will Immediately:
1. Create `gcc_rates` database table (schema already designed)
2. Build import script to populate table
3. Implement `lib/pcs/gcc-api.ts` lookup functions
4. Replace simplified PPM calculation
5. Test against move.mil calculator for accuracy
6. Update confidence scores to 100%

**Timeline:** 1-2 days after receiving data

---

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### Minimum Viable Data:
- At least 2025 CONUS rates
- Weight: 0-18,000 lbs (any bracket size)
- Distance: 0-3,000 miles (any band size)
- Formula or lookup table format

### Ideal Data:
- 2025 rates for all zones (CONUS, AK, HI, OCONUS)
- Detailed weight brackets (100 lb increments)
- Detailed distance bands (variable increments)
- Seasonal multipliers (peak/non-peak)
- Digital format (CSV, JSON, Excel, or API)

### Minimum to Launch:
- Even if we only get a PDF table, we can manually enter ~500 key rates
- Better to launch with partial GCC coverage than simplified estimates
- Can expand coverage later as we get more data

---

## 🔄 **FALLBACK OPTIONS**

### If GCC Data Unavailable After 1 Week:

**Option A: Reverse-Engineer from move.mil**
- Build script to query calculator with 100 scenarios
- Extract rates from responses
- Build our own rate table
- **Time:** 2-3 days
- **Risk:** Terms of Service compliance

**Option B: Launch with Disclaimer**
- Keep simplified PPM formula
- Add prominent warning: "PPM estimate only - verify with move.mil"
- Link to official calculator
- Update when GCC data acquired
- **Time:** Immediate
- **Risk:** Less trust from users

**Option C: Remove PPM from Tool**
- Focus on DLA, TLE, MALT, Per Diem (all 100% accurate)
- Remove PPM section entirely
- Link to move.mil for PPM estimates
- **Time:** 30 minutes
- **Risk:** Reduced tool value

**My Recommendation:** Pursue official data for 1 week, then decide on fallback

## 📞 **HOW TO SHARE FINDINGS WITH ME**

### Ongoing Communication:
- Share findings as you discover them (don't wait to compile everything)
- Screenshots are helpful
- Links to official sources are critical
- "Negative results" are useful too (tells me what won't work)

### Async Updates:
```
Quick update:
- ✅ Tested move.mil calculator - found API endpoint!
- ✅ Email sent to DTMO
- ⏳ Waiting on response
- ❌ GSA API doesn't have PPM rates

Attached: network-tab-screenshot.png, api-response.json

---

## ⏰ **TIMELINE PROJECTION**

### Optimistic (1 week):
- **Days 1-2:** You find move.mil API
- **Day 3:** I implement GCC lookup
- **Day 4:** Testing and validation
- **Day 5:** Production launch

### Realistic (2 weeks):
- **Week 1:** Research + DTMO response
- **Days 8-10:** Implement + test
- **Days 11-12:** Beta testing
- **Week 3:** Production launch

### Conservative (3-4 weeks):
- **Weeks 1-2:** Official data acquisition
- **Week 3:** Implementation + testing
- **Week 4:** Beta + production launch

**Don't Rush:** Better to get official data correctly than launch with hacky workarounds
