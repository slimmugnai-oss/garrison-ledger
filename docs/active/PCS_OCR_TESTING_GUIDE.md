## üìÑ OPTION 2: FIND SAMPLE DOCUMENTS ONLINE

### Where to Find Sample Military Documents

**1. Official DoD Sample Forms:**
- [DoD Forms Management](https://www.esd.whs.mil/DD/)
- Search for "DD 1351-2 sample" (travel voucher)
- Search for "DA Form 31 sample" (leave form, similar format)

**2. Military Community Forums:**
- Reddit r/Military
- Army subreddit often has redacted order examples
- Search for "PCS orders example" or "sample PCS orders"

**3. Military Transition Sites:**
- Military OneSource resources
- Transition Assistance Program (TAP) materials
- Often include sample documents

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** If using real samples from forums:
- Make sure they're redacted (no SSN, real names, etc.)
- Use for testing only
- Don't save/distribute actual military documents

---

## üß™ HOW TO TEST

### Step 1: Create or Download Test Document

Choose one of the sample documents above or find a redacted sample online.

### Step 2: Upload to PCS Copilot

1. Go to `/dashboard/pcs-copilot`
2. Create a new claim (or open existing)
3. Click "Upload Documents"
4. Select document type:
   - **PCS Orders** (most important to test!)
   - **Weigh Ticket**
   - **Lodging Receipt**
   - **Fuel Receipt**
   - **Meal Receipt**
5. Upload your test document

### Step 3: Watch OCR Processing

**What Should Happen:**

1. **Upload Progress:**
   ```
   Uploading document... ‚úì
   Processing OCR... ‚è≥
   ```

2. **OCR Extraction:**
   - Takes 5-15 seconds for Gemini Vision to process
   - You'll see a "Processing" status
   - Then switches to "Completed" or "Needs Review"

3. **Auto-Fill:**
   - For PCS Orders: Should auto-populate:
     - Member name
     - Rank
     - Branch
     - Dates (orders, departure, report)
     - Origin base
     - Destination base
     - Dependents count
     - Weight allowance

4. **Confidence Scoring:**
   ```
   OCR Confidence: 92% (High)
   
   Field Scores:
   ‚úÖ Member Name: 95% (Excellent)
   ‚úÖ Rank: 95% (Excellent)
   ‚úÖ Branch: 100% (Excellent)
   ‚úÖ Orders Date: 95% (Excellent)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Origin Base: 75% (Good - verify)
   ‚úÖ Destination Base: 90% (Excellent)
   ```

## üîç WHAT THE OCR LOOKS FOR

### For PCS Orders (Most Complex)

**Step 1: Branch Detection**
- Scans for "DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY", "DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY", etc.
- Uses branch-specific prompts for better accuracy

**Step 2: Data Extraction**
- **Member Name:** Looks for "Last, First Middle" format
- **Rank:** Searches for paygrades (E-5, O-3) and abbreviations (SSG, CPT)
- **Bases:** Normalizes abbreviations:
  - "Ft Bragg" ‚Üí "Fort Liberty, NC"
  - "JBLM" ‚Üí "Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA"
  - "NAS Pensacola" ‚Üí "Naval Air Station Pensacola, FL"
- **Dates:** Converts all formats to YYYY-MM-DD:
  - "15 JAN 2025" ‚Üí "2025-01-15"
  - "01/15/2025" ‚Üí "2025-01-15"
  - "Jan 15, 2025" ‚Üí "2025-01-15"
- **Dependents:** Extracts count from "authorized dependents: 2"
- **Weight:** Extracts from "HHG weight allowance: 12,000 lbs"

**Common Errors Avoided:**
- ‚úÖ Doesn't confuse O (Officer) with 0 (zero)
- ‚úÖ Doesn't confuse TDY (temporary) with PCS (permanent)
- ‚úÖ Doesn't mix up orders_date vs report_date
- ‚úÖ Includes state/location with base names

---

### For Weigh Tickets

**Looks For:**
- Empty weight (before loading)
- Full weight (after loading)
- Net weight (difference)
- Date
- Location (scale address)
- Vehicle description

---

### For Receipts (Lodging/Fuel/Meals)

**Looks For:**
- Vendor/business name
- Location (city, state)
- Date
- Total amount
- For lodging: check-in/check-out dates, nights
- For fuel: gallons, price per gallon

---

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Order number (75% - location varies)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Weight allowance (85% - sometimes not on orders)

**Possible Issues:**
- Dependents count may be missing (not always on orders)
- PPM authorization sometimes buried in notes section

---

### Weigh Tickets
**Typical Accuracy:** 90-95%

**High Confidence:**
- ‚úÖ Empty/full weight (95% - large numbers, prominent)
- ‚úÖ Date (90% - standardized)
- ‚úÖ Location (85% - address format)

**Possible Issues:**
- Net weight may need calculation if not printed

**Typical Accuracy:** 85-95%

**High Confidence:**
- ‚úÖ Total amount (95% - always prominent)
- ‚úÖ Vendor name (90% - top of receipt)
- ‚úÖ Date (90% - standardized)

**Possible Issues:**
- Location may be abbreviated
- For fuel: gallons may not be extracted if hand-written

---

## üö¶ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "OCR Confidence: 45% (Low)"

**Causes:**
- Document is blurry/unreadable
- Handwritten text (OCR works best with typed text)
- Unusual format (non-standard orders)

**Fix:**
- Take clearer photo
- Use scanner instead of phone camera
- Manually enter data (OCR is optional)

---

### Issue: "OCR Failed"

**Causes:**
- File too large (>10MB)
- Unsupported format
- Gemini API issue

**Fix:**
- Compress image/PDF
- Convert to JPG or PNG
- Try again (API may be temporarily down)
- Manually enter data

---

### Issue: "Some Fields Missing"

**This is NORMAL!** OCR won't extract everything.

**Common Missing Fields:**
- Dependents count (often not on orders)
- Weight allowance (sometimes in separate document)
- PPM authorization (may use different wording)

**Fix:**
- Manually enter missing fields
- OCR saves time, doesn't replace review

---

---

## üì± TESTING ON MOBILE

### Best Practices for Phone Testing

**1. Good Lighting:**
- Use natural light or bright indoor lighting
- Avoid shadows across document
- Don't use flash (creates glare)

**2. Straight-On Photo:**
- Hold phone directly above document
- Keep edges in frame
- Avoid angles/perspective distortion

**3. Focus:**
- Tap screen to focus on text
- Make sure text is sharp before taking photo
- Zoom if needed for small text

**4. File Size:**
- Phone photos work fine (usually 2-5MB)
- If OCR fails, try compressing image
- PDFs are best if you can scan

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CHECKLIST

Before testing, make sure you have:

- [ ] Premium account (OCR is premium-only)
- [ ] Test documents ready (samples above or redacted real ones)
- [ ] Created a test PCS claim
- [ ] Know what data to expect (so you can verify OCR accuracy)

**After Upload:**

- [ ] Check OCR confidence score (should be 70%+)
- [ ] Verify extracted fields match document
- [ ] Correct any errors manually
- [ ] Check that form fields auto-populate
- [ ] Verify calculations use extracted data

---

## üéì UNDERSTANDING OCR LIMITATIONS

### What OCR Does WELL ‚úÖ

- Typed/printed text (95%+ accuracy)
- Standard formats (receipts, official forms)
- Clear photos/scans
- Well-lit documents
- Common military abbreviations

### What OCR Struggles With ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Handwritten text (60-70% accuracy)
- Faded/old documents
- Complex layouts (multiple columns)
- Non-standard formats
- Very small text (<8pt font)

### Why Manual Review is REQUIRED

**Even with 95% OCR confidence:**
- Dates may be transposed (Jun 3 vs Mar 6)
- Amounts may have decimal errors ($123.45 vs $12.345)
- Base names may be abbreviated wrong
- Rank may confuse O vs 0

**Always review OCR results before submitting!**

---

## üöÄ READY TO TEST?

### Quick Start:

1. **Create test PCS orders** using Army sample above
2. **Save as PDF** or take screenshot
3. **Create test claim** in PCS Copilot
4. **Upload as "PCS Orders"**
5. **Wait 10-15 seconds** for OCR
6. **Review extracted data**

**Expected Result:**
```
‚úÖ OCR Completed: 90% confidence
‚úÖ 8/9 required fields extracted
‚ö†Ô∏è 1 field needs review
‚úÖ Form auto-populated
üéØ Ready for manual review
```

---

## üìÅ TEST DOCUMENT TEMPLATES

**I've provided 4 ready-to-use templates above:**

1. ‚úÖ Army PCS Orders (most comprehensive)
2. ‚úÖ Weigh Ticket (empty weight)
3. ‚úÖ Hotel Receipt (Hampton Inn)
4. ‚úÖ Fuel Receipt (Shell)

**Just copy-paste into Word/Google Docs, save as PDF, and upload!**

---

## üí° PRO TIPS

**For Best OCR Results:**

1. **Use PDF instead of photo** (if you can scan)
2. **Make text at least 11pt font** (easier to read)
3. **Keep documents straight** (not rotated/skewed)
4. **Use high contrast** (black text on white background)
5. **Test with different branches** (verify branch-specific prompts work)

**For Realistic Testing:**

1. **Mix quality levels** - test both perfect and degraded
2. **Test edge cases** - very short names, unusual bases
3. **Test errors** - intentionally create bad data to see error handling
4. **Test all document types** - don't just test PCS orders

---

## üéñÔ∏è WHEN TO USE REAL DOCUMENTS

**Once you have actual PCS orders:**

1. **Upload redacted version** (black out SSN, full name if you want)
2. **Compare OCR to actual data** (accuracy check)
3. **Report any extraction errors** (helps us improve prompts)
4. **Use for real claim** (now you know it works!)

---

**Ready to test!** Start with the Army PCS Orders sample - it has the most fields and will give you the best sense of OCR capabilities. üöÄ
