## 5Ô∏è‚É£ PPM (PERSONALLY PROCURED MOVE) - **USER-ENTERED GCC**

### Data Source
**Official Source:** **NONE** (User enters GCC from MilMove)  
**Reason:** GCC rates are PROPRIETARY (Global Household Goods Contract pricing)  

### Why We Don't Calculate GCC

**Research Findings (October 2025):**
1. **DTMO GCC rates are not publicly available**
   - Proprietary contract pricing
   - Calculated by MilMove using restricted rate tables
   - No public API or downloadable tables

2. **Legal/Compliance Risk:**
   - Cannot replicate official rates
   - Risk of calculation errors
   - User would compare to MilMove and lose trust

3. **Official Source is Authoritative:**
   - MilMove provides official GCC during counseling
   - User copies exact amount to our calculator
   - We calculate withholding from THEIR official GCC

### Our PPM Implementation (Two-Path System)

#### Path 1: Official (100% Confidence)
**User Workflow:**
1. User gets GCC from MilMove/counseling session
2. User enters exact GCC amount in our tool
3. User selects incentive percentage (100% or 130%)
4. User enters allowed expenses (fuel, labor, tolls, supplies)
5. We calculate estimated DFAS withholding

**Example:**
```
GCC from MilMove: $8,500
Incentive: 100%
Gross Payout: $8,500

Allowed Expenses:
- Moving supplies: $1,200
- Fuel receipts: $800
- Labor costs: $300
- Tolls/fees: $100
Total Expenses: $2,400

Taxable Amount: $6,100

Estimated Withholding:
- Federal (22% IRS supplemental): $1,342
- State (WA 0%): $0
- FICA (6.2%): $378.20
- Medicare (1.45%): $88.45
Total Withholding: $1,808.65

NET PAYOUT: $6,691.35
```

#### Path 2: Estimator (50% Confidence)
**User Workflow:**
1. User planning a move (no MilMove GCC yet)
2. User enters weight and distance
3. We provide rough estimate using simplified formula
4. Marked as "PLANNING ONLY" with low confidence

**Formula:**
```
GCC_ESTIMATE = (weight_lbs / 100) √ó (distance_miles / 100) √ó $4
```

**Example:**
```
Weight: 8,000 lbs
Distance: 2,850 miles
GCC Estimate: ~$9,120 (rough planning figure)
```

**Disclaimer:** Estimator is for planning only. Actual GCC from MilMove will differ.

### Update Schedule
**Frequency:** N/A (user-entered data)  
**Maintenance:** Update disclaimers and IRS withholding rates annually

### Federal Withholding
**Rate:** 22% (flat supplemental wage rate for payments <$1M)  
**Source:** IRS Pub 15, Page 17  
**Update:** Annual (January when new Pub 15 released)

### State Withholding
**Source:** State tax authority tables  
**Table:** `state_tax_rates`

- **All States:** Verified using supplemental wage rates, not sales tax
- **Display Format:** Fixed to show percentages consistently (5.75% not 0.0575)

**Update Schedule:** Annual (January)

### Verification Query
```sql
SELECT 
  state_code,
  state_name,
  COALESCE(flat_rate, avg_rate_mid) as effective_rate,

  customFederalRate: 24, // If user knows their W-4 bracket
  customStateRate: 5.5,   // If user knows their state withholding
  yearToDateFICA: 50000,  // For FICA cap calculation
});

// Result includes:
// - grossPayout
// - taxableAmount
// - estimatedWithholding (federal, state, FICA, Medicare)
// - totalWithholding
// - estimatedNetPayout
// - confidence (100 for official, 50 for estimator)
