## ✅ PHASE 1: API INTEGRATION AUDIT (COMPLETED)

### **Weather API (Google Weather API)**

- ✅ Fixed API parsing to use correct Google Weather API schema:
  - `temperature.degrees` (not `temperature`)
  - `feelsLikeTemperature.degrees` (not `temperatureApparent`)
  - `weatherCondition.description.text` (not `condition`)
  - `relativeHumidity` (already 0-100, not decimal)
  - `wind.speed.value` with km/h to mph conversion

**API Key:** `AIza****puU` (masked - get from Vercel env vars)
