## ✅ PHASE 1: API INTEGRATION AUDIT (COMPLETED)

### **Weather API (Google Weather API)**
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND WORKING

**Issues Found:**
- ❌ Incorrect API response parsing (was using wrong field names)
- ❌ Temperature not converting properly from Celsius to Fahrenheit
- ❌ Humidity calculation was incorrect
- ❌ Wind speed not converting from km/h to mph

**Solutions Implemented:**
- ✅ Fixed API parsing to use correct Google Weather API schema:
  - `temperature.degrees` (not `temperature`)
  - `feelsLikeTemperature.degrees` (not `temperatureApparent`)
  - `weatherCondition.description.text` (not `condition`)
  - `relativeHumidity` (already 0-100, not decimal)
  - `wind.speed.value` with km/h to mph conversion

**API Key:** `AIzaSyCgVJ6wbaox0bBaBSeQgTFqOA1alEsnpuU`  
**Cost:** $0/month (free with restrictions)  
**Test Result:** ✅ Returns real data (60°F, 89% humidity, "Partly cloudy")

---

### **Housing API (Zillow via RapidAPI)**
**Status:** ✅ WORKING

**Features:**
- ✅ Real median home prices
- ✅ Price per square foot
- ✅ Zestimate values
- ✅ Market trends (Seller's/Buyer's/Balanced)
- ✅ Teaser data for free users (80-95% of actual values)

**API Key:** `5e108b70f9msh6da7ae3d2bb14d6p163f38jsn85ac0a5ab688`  
**Cost:** $25/month (unlimited usage)  
**Test Result:** ✅ Returns real data ($238,500 median, $131/sqft)

---

### **Schools API (GreatSchools)**
**Status:** ✅ WORKING (Premium/Pro Only)

**Features:**
- ✅ Average school ratings (0-10 scale)
