## Understanding Audit Results

### Example Red Flag: BAH Mismatch

```
üî¥ BAH MISMATCH
Expected: $1,500/month
Actual: $1,350/month
Difference: +$150 underpaid

What to do: Contact your finance office. You should be receiving $1,500 
based on your rank (E-5), location (Fort Liberty, NC), and dependent 
status (with dependents). Bring this audit report.
```

**Action Steps:**
1. Verify your profile info is correct (rank, base, deps)
2. Check if you recently PCS'd (rate change delay is normal)
3. Export audit PDF
4. Visit finance office or submit ticket
5. Reference DFAS BAH calculator: https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/bahCalc.cfm

### Example Yellow Flag: Minor Variance

```
‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR VARIANCE
Expected BAS: $460.66
Actual BAS: $459.50
Difference: $1.16 difference

What to do: Monitor next month's LES. Small variances can occur due to 
mid-month changes or partial pay periods. If it persists, follow up 
with finance.
```

### Example Green Flag: All Correct

```
‚úÖ BAH CORRECT
Expected: $1,500/month
Actual: $1,500/month

Your BAH is correct for E-5 with dependents at Fort Liberty, NC.

- Report any bugs to support

## FAQ

### How accurate is the audit?

**99%+ accurate for standard allowances (BAH/BAS).**

We use official DFAS rates tables and rigorous comparison thresholds. However:
- Always verify with official DFAS calculator
- Mid-month changes may cause temporary variances
- Service-specific special pays may not be covered yet

### Can I audit historical LES?

**Yes!** Upload any LES from January 2020 onwards.

Historical audits help you:
- Find past underpayments
- Build case for back pay
- Verify promotion took effect correctly

### Does this replace talking to finance?

**No.** LES Auditor helps you:
- Identify issues BEFORE going to finance
- Bring data-backed evidence
- Know what questions to ask

You still need finance to fix discrepancies.

### What if I disagree with the audit?

1. Click "Data Sources" to see how we calculated
2. Verify your profile info is correct
3. Use official DFAS calculators to cross-check
4. Contact support if you believe there's a bug

### Can I share my audit report?

**Yes!** Use the "Export as PDF" button to:
- Save for your records
- Bring to finance office
- Email to spouse or POC

**Privacy:** PDF contains only the audit results, not your full LES.
