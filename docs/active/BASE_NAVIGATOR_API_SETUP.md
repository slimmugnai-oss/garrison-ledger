# üîë Base Navigator API Setup Guide

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-20  
**Purpose:** Configure external APIs for Base Navigator tool

---

## üìã Required API Keys

Base Navigator uses 4 external APIs:

| API | Provider | Purpose | Cost | Setup Time |
|-----|----------|---------|------|------------|
| **Google Maps** | Google Cloud | Commute times | ‚úÖ Already configured | - |
| **GreatSchools v2** | GreatSchools | School ratings | Free | 5 min |
| **Zillow** | RapidAPI | Housing/rent data | Free tier | 5 min |
| **OpenWeatherMap** | OpenWeatherMap | Weather comfort | Free tier | 5 min |

---

## ‚úÖ **1. Google Unified API** (Weather + Places + Distance Matrix)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **LIVE** - All Google services now use single API key

**Environment Variable:** `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

**What It Powers:**
- **Weather:** Real-time temperature, conditions, humidity
- **Amenities:** Grocery stores, restaurants, gyms, hospitals within 5km radius
- **Commute:** AM/PM drive times with traffic to base gate

**Verification:** 
- Weather shows real temperature (not generic "Moderate climate")
- Amenities show non-zero counts (not all 0s)
- Commute shows realistic times based on actual traffic

**APIs Enabled:**
1. Current Weather API (`weather.googleapis.com/v1/currentWeather`)
2. Places API (New) (`places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchNearby`)
3. Distance Matrix API (`maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix`)

**No action needed if already configured!**

## ‚úÖ **2. SchoolDigger API** (School Ratings)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **LIVE** - Real school data from SchoolDigger

**Environment Variables:**
- `SCHOOLDIGGER_APP_ID` 
- `SCHOOLDIGGER_APP_KEY`

**What It Powers:**
- School names, ratings (0-10 scale), grade ranges
- Up to 25 schools per ZIP code
- Public and private schools
- Distance from ZIP center

**Verification:**
- Schools section shows real school names (not "N/A")
- Ratings based on SchoolDigger rankStars (1-5 stars ‚Üí 0-10 scale)
- See console logs: `[SCHOOLS] Fetched X schools for ZIP`

### **Setup Steps (if not configured):**

1. **Sign Up for SchoolDigger:**
   - Go to: https://developer.schooldigger.com/
   - Create developer account
   - Subscribe to free tier (1,000 requests/month)

2. **Get Credentials:**
   - After signup, you'll receive `appID` and `appKey`
   - **Note:** These are NOT the same as API keys - they're URL parameters

3. **Add to Vercel (2 variables needed):**
   ```
   Name: SCHOOLDIGGER_APP_ID
   Value: your-app-id-here
   
   Name: SCHOOLDIGGER_APP_KEY
   Value: your-app-key-here
   ```

### **Troubleshooting:**

**Error: SchoolDigger API authentication failed**
- Check both `SCHOOLDIGGER_APP_ID` and `SCHOOLDIGGER_APP_KEY` are set
- Verify credentials from SchoolDigger dashboard
- Ensure no extra spaces when copying

**No schools showing:**
- Check Vercel logs for `[SCHOOLS]` messages
- May return 0 schools for remote/rural ZIP codes (expected)
- Falls back to empty array on error (doesn't break page)

---

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è **3. Demographics Data** (Intentional Defaults)

**Status:** ‚ÑπÔ∏è **USING DEFAULTS** - Not a bug, intentional design

**What It Shows:**
- Population, median age, median income
- Diversity index, family household percentage
- Region-specific estimates based on ZIP code

**Why Defaults:**
- Real demographics APIs (US Census, RapidAPI) are costly or complex
- Demographics don't change frequently enough to justify real-time API costs
- Regional defaults provide reasonable estimates for military audience

**Future:** Could integrate US Census API if highly accurate demographics become critical

---

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è **4. Military Amenities** (Intentional Defaults)

**Status:** ‚ÑπÔ∏è **USING DEFAULTS** - Not a bug, intentional design

**What It Shows:**
- Military facility proximity score
- Generic assessments of military housing distance
- Region-specific estimates

**Why Defaults:**
- Searching for military facilities near civilian housing is complex
- No publicly available API for military installation proximity
- Better UX to show generic scores than confusing/inaccurate data

**Future:** Could integrate DMDC installation database if made available

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPRECATED APIS** (No Longer Used)

### **Setup Steps:**

1. **Sign Up for RapidAPI:**
   - Go to: https://rapidapi.com/
   - Create free account
   - Confirm email

2. **Subscribe to Zillow API:**
   - Search: "Zillow" in RapidAPI marketplace
   - Select: "Zillow API" (by apimaker)
   - Subscribe to **Basic Plan** (free - 500 requests/month)
   - Note: There are multiple Zillow APIs - use "zillow-com1.p.rapidapi.com"

3. **Get Your API Key:**
   - After subscribing, go to: Code Snippets tab
   - Copy your `X-RapidAPI-Key` value
   - Also note the `X-RapidAPI-Host` (should be `zillow-com1.p.rapidapi.com`)

4. **Add to Vercel (2 env vars needed):**
   ```
   Name: RAPIDAPI_KEY
   Value: your-rapidapi-key-here
   
   Name: ZILLOW_RAPIDAPI_HOST
   Value: zillow-com1.p.rapidapi.com
   ```

### **Troubleshooting:**

**Error: "Zillow API not configured. Host: set, Key: missing"**
- You have `ZILLOW_RAPIDAPI_HOST` but missing `RAPIDAPI_KEY`
- Add `RAPIDAPI_KEY` env var to Vercel

**Error: 403 Forbidden**
- Not subscribed to Zillow API on RapidAPI
- Go to RapidAPI dashboard ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Subscribe

**Error: 429 Too Many Requests**
- Hit free tier limit (500/month)
- Wait until next month or upgrade plan

## üÜï **4. OpenWeatherMap API** (New - Just Implemented)

**Current Status:** Not configured - needs API key

### **Setup Steps:**

1. **Sign Up:**
   - Go to: https://openweathermap.org/api
   - Click "Sign Up" (free account)
   - Confirm email

2. **Get API Key:**
   - After login, go to: API Keys tab
   - Copy your default API key (auto-generated)
   - **Note:** API key activation takes ~10 minutes after signup

3. **Add to Vercel:**
   ```
   Name: OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
   Value: your-openweather-api-key-here
   ```

4. **Verify It Works:**
   ```bash
   curl "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?zip=98498,US&appid=YOUR_KEY&units=imperial"
   ```
   - Should return 5-day forecast JSON
   - If you get 401, API key not activated yet (wait 10 min)

### **Troubleshooting:**

**Error: 401 Unauthorized**
- API key not activated yet (wait 10-15 minutes after signup)
- Or API key is invalid

**Error: "Weather data unavailable"**
- API key not set in Vercel
- Or API key not activated yet

---

## üöÄ **After Adding Keys: MUST REDEPLOY**

**CRITICAL:** New environment variables only take effect after redeployment!

### **How to Redeploy:**

1. Go to: Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí garrison-ledger ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click latest deployment (top of list)
3. Click "‚ãØ" menu ‚Üí "Redeploy"
4. Wait ~2 minutes for deployment to complete
5. **OR** just push any commit to GitHub (auto-deploys)

**Why:** Vercel builds static environment variables into the build. Adding them doesn't update running containers.

---

## üß™ **Testing After Setup**

### **1. Check Vercel Logs:**

1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Logs
2. Filter by: `/api/navigator/base`
3. Look for success messages:
   - `[Schools] Fetched 12 schools for ZIP 98498`
   - `[Housing] Median rent: $2200 for 3BR in 98498`
   - `[Weather] Comfort index: 8.2 for ZIP 98498`

### **2. Test Base Navigator:**

1. Go to: https://app.familymedia.com/dashboard/navigator/jblm
2. Enter:
   - Bedrooms: 3
   - BAH: $2,598
   - Kids: 1 Elementary
3. Click "Find Best Neighborhoods"

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ **Commute:** AM 9min / PM 10min (Google Maps)
- ‚úÖ **Schools:** Franklin Pierce Elementary: 8/10 (GreatSchools)
- ‚úÖ **Housing:** Median rent: $2,200/mo (Zillow)
- ‚úÖ **Weather:** 75¬∞F highs, 35¬∞F lows (OpenWeatherMap)

## üìä **API Cost Breakdown**

| API | Free Tier | Expected Monthly Usage | Overage Cost |
|-----|-----------|------------------------|--------------|
| Google Maps | $200 credit | ~$5-10/month | $0.005/request |
| GreatSchools | Unlimited | ~500 requests/month | N/A (free) |
| Zillow (RapidAPI) | 500 requests/month | ~200 requests/month | $0.01/request |
| OpenWeatherMap | 1,000 requests/day | ~100 requests/day | N/A (won't hit) |

**Total Monthly Cost:** $0-5 (assuming normal usage within free tiers)

**Notes:**
- Base Navigator caches results for 24h
- Each ZIP code cached = 4 API calls saved (schools, housing, weather, commute)
- 90%+ of requests should hit cache
