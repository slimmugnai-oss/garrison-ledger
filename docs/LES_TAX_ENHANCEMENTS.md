# LES Auditor Tax Enhancements

**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed  
**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Impact:** Significant UX improvement + Educational value

---

## Summary

Enhanced the LES Auditor tax section with auto-calculation for FICA/Medicare and intelligent validation with AI-powered explanations for all tax withholdings.

---

## Phase 1 Features (Now Live)

### 1. Auto-Calculate FICA & Medicare

**What it does:**
- Automatically calculates FICA (6.2%) and Medicare (1.45%) based on taxable gross pay
- Taxable gross = Base Pay + COLA + SDAP + HFP/IDP + FSA + FLPP (excludes BAH/BAS)
- Pre-fills fields when user enters entitlements
- User can edit if their LES shows different amounts (rare edge cases)

**UI Indicators:**
- Green highlight on auto-calculated fields
- ‚úì badge showing "Calculated (6.2%)" or "Calculated (1.45%)"
- Info banner explaining the auto-calculation
- Help text: "Auto-calculated at 6.2% of taxable gross - edit if your LES differs"

**User Benefits:**
- Saves typing time (2 fewer fields to manually enter)
- Reduces transcription errors
- Educational (shows how FICA/Medicare are calculated)

### 2. Tax Validation Logic

**Validation Rules:**

#### FICA (6.2% exact)
- **Tolerance:** ¬±$0.05
- **Action:** Warn if outside tolerance
- **Example:** "FICA is $193.80 but expected $193.75 (6.2% of taxable gross). Check your LES."

#### Medicare (1.45% exact)
- **Tolerance:** ¬±$0.02
- **Action:** Warn if outside tolerance
- **Example:** "Medicare is $45.35 but expected $45.31 (1.45% of taxable gross). Check your LES."

#### Federal Tax (8-22% typical)
- **Low Threshold:** <5% of taxable gross
- **High Threshold:** >25% of taxable gross
- **Action:** Advisory (not error)
- **Example Low:** "Your federal tax (3.2%) seems low. Typical range: 10-15%. This might be correct if you have many exemptions."
- **Example High:** "Your federal tax (28.1%) seems high. Typical range: 10-15%. This might be correct if you requested additional withholding."

#### State Tax (state-specific ranges)
- **Ranges:**
  - No-income-tax states (TX, FL, WA, AK, NV, SD, WY): 0%
  - Low-tax states (TN, NH): 0-5%
  - Typical states (CA: 1-10%, NY: 4-8%)
- **Tolerance:** 1.5x max rate
- **Action:** Advisory if exceeds
- **Example:** "Your CA state tax (12.3%) seems high. Typical range: 1-10%."

#### Total Tax Burden
- **Threshold:** >35% combined (Federal + State + FICA + Medicare)
- **Action:** Warn
- **Example:** "Total tax burden is 37.2% - higher than typical 25-30%. Verify all amounts with your LES."

### 3. AI-Powered Explanations

**When generated:**
- Whenever a tax validation flag is triggered (warning or advisory)
- Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for fast, cost-effective explanations

**Explanation format:**
- 4-6 sentences
- Conversational, reassuring tone
- Covers: why it might be happening, if it's concerning, what to do next

**Example AI Explanation (High Federal Tax):**

> "Your federal tax withholding is higher than typical for your rank, which can happen for a few reasons. The most common is that you've requested additional withholding on your W-4 form (Extra withholding, Box 4c), which some service members do to get a bigger refund or avoid owing taxes at the end of the year. Another possibility is that this is a catch-up withholding if you had incorrect settings earlier in the year, or if you received a bonus or special pay this period that bumped you into a higher bracket temporarily. This isn't necessarily a problem‚Äîit just means more money is going to the IRS now, which you'll get back as a refund if you overpaid. If you didn't intend to have this much withheld, check your W-4 form with your finance office to make sure the settings match your desired withholding. You can also use the IRS withholding calculator at irs.gov/W4App to see if your current settings are appropriate for your situation."

**Topics covered:**
- W-4 settings (allowances, extra withholding)
- YTD catch-up adjustments
- Bonuses and special pays
- Tax bracket considerations
- State-specific rules (for state tax)
- Next steps (check W-4, contact finance, verify LES)

## Cost Analysis

**AI Explanation Costs:**
- Model: Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Tokens per explanation: ~500 (4-6 sentences)
- Cost per explanation: ~$0.005
- Typical audit: 0-2 explanations (most users have correct taxes)
- Average cost per audit: ~$0.01
- Cost per 100 audits: ~$1.00

**Comparison:**
- GPT-4o would cost ~$0.05 per explanation (10x more)
- No AI: $0 but less educational value
- **Decision:** Gemini 2.5 Flash is perfect balance of quality and cost
