## Implementation Details

### Phase 0: Database Schema Standardization ✅

**Problem:** Multiple conflicting field names across codebase (`time_in_service_months` vs `years_of_service`, `num_children` vs `dependents`, etc.)

**Solution:** Created comprehensive migration to standardize on:
- `years_of_service` (int) - Matches DFAS pay tables and YOS logic
- `has_dependents` (boolean) - For BAH/COLA with-dependents rates
- `dependents_count` (int) - For future features needing actual count
- `with_dependents` (computed alias) - Backward compatibility

**Files:**
- ✅ Created: `supabase-migrations/20250123_user_profiles_standardize_fields.sql`

**Features:**
- Backfills existing data from legacy columns
- Maintains backward compatibility with `with_dependents` alias
- Adds constraints (non-negative, reasonable ranges)
- Includes comprehensive verification queries
- Full documentation of naming conventions

---

### Phase 1: Templates API Fix ✅

**Problem:** API querying non-existent columns:
- ❌ `base` (should be `current_base`)
- ❌ `dependents` (should be `has_dependents`, `dependents_count`)
- ❌ Old logic using wrong field names

**Solution:** Updated query and personalization logic

**Files:**
- ✅ Modified: `app/api/ask/templates/route.ts`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// OLD (BROKEN)
.select("rank, base, dependents, years_of_service")

// NEW (FIXED)
.select("rank, current_base, years_of_service, has_dependents, dependents_count, marital_status")
```

**Improvements:**
- Personalized templates now show actual dependent count
- Questions more specific (e.g., "with 2 children" instead of generic "for my family")
- All field references match database schema

---

### Phase 2: State Management Wrapper ✅

**Problem:** Main page is Server Component but needs client-side state to connect QuestionComposer (input) → AnswerDisplay (output)

**Solution:** Created `AskAssistantClient` wrapper component

**Files:**
- ✅ Created: `app/components/ask/AskAssistantClient.tsx` (211 lines)

**Features:**
- Manages answer/loading/error state
- Handles full question submission lifecycle
- Coordinates between all child components
- Implements error handling with user-friendly messages
- Refreshes credit meter after successful submit
- Tracks analytics events
- Supports template question filling

**Key Functionality:**
```typescript
const [answer, setAnswer] = useState<AnswerData | null>(null);
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
const [currentQuestion, setCurrentQuestion] = useState("");

const handleQuestionSubmit = async (question, templateId) => {
  // Full API call, error handling, credit refresh
  const response = await fetch("/api/ask/submit", {...});
  setAnswer(result.answer);
  await creditMeterRef.current.refresh();
};
```

---

### Phase 3: Main Page Refactor ✅

**Problem:** Page rendering disconnected components without state props

**Solution:** Simplified to use new Client wrapper

**Files:**
- ✅ Modified: `app/dashboard/ask/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed direct component rendering
- Integrated `AskAssistantClient` wrapper
- Kept Server Component for auth check
- Cleaner, more maintainable structure

**Before:** 135 lines with complex layout  
**After:** 102 lines with clean delegation

---

### Phase 4: QuestionComposer Refactor ✅

**Problem:** Component handling its own API calls, not passing results to parent

**Solution:** Simplified to delegate all API logic to parent

**Files:**
- ✅ Modified: `app/components/ask/QuestionComposer.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed internal API calling logic
- Removed unused `_handleTemplateClick` method
- Added support for external question filling via props
- Now purely presentational with event delegation

**Improvements:**
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Parent controls full lifecycle
- Easier to test and maintain
- Supports pre-filling from templates

---

### Phase 5: CreditMeter Enhancement ✅

**Problem:** No way for parent to refresh credit count after submission

**Solution:** Added `forwardRef` with `refresh` method

**Files:**
- ✅ Modified: `app/components/ask/CreditMeter.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Expose refresh method via ref
useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
  refresh: fetchCredits,
}));
```

**Usage:**
```typescript
// In parent component
await creditMeterRef.current.refresh();
```

4. Test error handling
5. Verify RLS policies
6. Performance check

**Quick Smoke Test (5 min):**
1. Load page
2. Click template
3. Submit question
4. Verify answer
5. Check credit decrement
6. Console: 0 errors

## Database Changes

### Migration Required
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: supabase-migrations/20250123_user_profiles_standardize_fields.sql
```

### Schema Impact
- Adds 3 new columns: `years_of_service`, `has_dependents`, `dependents_count`
- Adds 1 computed column: `with_dependents`
- Backfills from existing: `time_in_service_months`, `num_children`, `marital_status`
- No data loss
- Backward compatible via alias

### Verification Query
```sql
SELECT 
  column_name, 
  data_type,
  is_nullable,
  column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'user_profiles' 
AND column_name IN ('years_of_service', 'has_dependents', 'dependents_count', 'with_dependents');
```
