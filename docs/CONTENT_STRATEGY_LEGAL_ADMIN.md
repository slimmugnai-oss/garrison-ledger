## Complete Guide Outlines (15 Guides)

### 1. Power of Attorney for Deployment: Types, Scope, and Revocation
**BLUF:** POA (Power of Attorney) gives spouse authority to handle finances/legal while you're deployed. Three types: General (broad), Special (limited), Springing (activates on condition).

### 2. Legal Assistance Office: Free Services Every Servicemember Should Use

**BLUF:** SCRA gives active duty servicemembers legal protections: 6% interest rate cap on pre-service debt, lease termination rights for PCS/deployment, eviction protection, foreclosure delay, default judgment protection. BUT you must REQUEST these protections - they're not automatic. Send military orders + written request to creditors/landlords.

### 4. Security Clearance Financial Requirements: Debt, Credit, and Investigation
**BLUF:** Security clearance investigation reviews: credit report, debt levels, payment history, bankruptcies, foreclosures, foreign contacts, criminal history. Financial red flags: debt collections, tax liens, foreclosures = clearance denial/revocation. Maintain: 650+ credit score, no collections, pay debts on time. Clearance = career, protect it.

### 5. Article 15 Financial Implications: NJP, Pay Reduction, and Recovery
**BLUF:** Article 15 (Non-Judicial Punishment) can include: reduction in rank (E-6 to E-5 = $400/mo pay cut = $9,600/year), forfeiture of pay (half month's pay × 2 months), extra duty. Financial recovery: rebuild emergency fund, adjust budget for reduced pay, avoid future discipline. Long-term: promotion eligibility impacted.

### 6. Chapter/Separation Process: Benefits Retention and Financial Timeline

**BLUF:** Changing name after marriage/divorce requires updates: DEERS (within 90 days), ID card, myPay, SGLI, TSP, bank accounts, driver's license, passport.

State court decides percentage (20-50% typical). DFAS pays ex-spouse directly if 10/10/10 rule met (10 years married, 10 years service overlap, 10 years marriage total).
