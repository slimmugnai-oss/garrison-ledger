## Caching Strategy

### Cache Duration

- **Rationale:** School ratings change annually; monthly updates sufficient
- **Storage:** Supabase `base_external_data` table

### Cache Keys
```typescript
const cacheKey = `schools:${baseId}:${month}`;
```

### Cache Invalidation
- Automatic after 30 days
- Manual refresh (Premium users only)
- No cache for Free tier (feature gated)
