## 📋 Implementation Details

### Part 1: LES Tax Enhancements

#### Files Modified:
1. **`app/components/les/LesAuditAlwaysOn.tsx`**
   - Added `useEffect` for FICA/Medicare auto-calculation (lines 168-189)
   - Added `taxValidation` memoized state (lines 297-350)
   - Added blue info banner for auto-calc explanation (lines 720-729)
   - Updated FICA/Medicare field labels with "✓ Auto-calc" badge (lines 745-758)
   - Added validation warning cards (red) and advisory cards (yellow) (lines 760-792)

2. **`lib/les/tax-advisor.ts`** (NEW FILE)
   - Created AI explanation generator using Gemini 2.5 Flash
   - Function: `generateTaxAdvisory(type, userValue, expectedValue, taxableGross, rank)`
   - Generates 4-6 sentence conversational explanations
   - Covers: W-4 settings, YTD catch-up, bonuses, SCRA, deployment tax exclusions
   - Cost: ~$0.01 per explanation (500 tokens)

#### How It Works:

**Auto-Calculation:**
```typescript
// Runs when Base Pay or COLA changes
const taxableGross = basePay + cola; // Excludes BAH/BAS (non-taxable)

if (taxableGross > 0) {
  if (fica === 0) {
    const calculatedFica = Math.round(taxableGross * 0.062);
    setFica(calculatedFica);
  }
  
  if (medicare === 0) {
    const calculatedMedicare = Math.round(taxableGross * 0.0145);
    setMedicare(calculatedMedicare);
  }
}
```

**Validation Logic:**
```typescript
// Runs in real-time as user types
const taxValidation = useMemo(() => {
  const warnings: string[] = [];
  const advisories: string[] = [];
  
  // FICA validation (exact check ± $5)
  const expectedFica = Math.round(taxableGross * 0.062);
  if (fica > 0 && Math.abs(fica - expectedFica) > 5) {
    warnings.push(`FICA should be $X.XX (6.2%). You have $Y.YY.`);
  }
  
  // Medicare validation (exact check ± $2)
  const expectedMedicare = Math.round(taxableGross * 0.0145);
  if (medicare > 0 && Math.abs(medicare - expectedMedicare) > 2) {
    warnings.push(`Medicare should be $X.XX (1.45%). You have $Y.YY.`);
  }
  
  // Federal tax reasonableness (10-15% typical)
  const federalPercent = (federalTax / taxableGross) * 100;
  if (federalPercent < 5) {
    advisories.push(`Federal tax (X.X%) seems low. Typical: 10-15%.`);
  } else if (federalPercent > 25) {
    advisories.push(`Federal tax (X.X%) seems high. Typical: 10-15%.`);
  }
  
  // Total tax burden check (shouldn't exceed 35%)
  const totalTaxes = federalTax + stateTax + fica + medicare;
  const totalPercent = (totalTaxes / taxableGross) * 100;
  if (totalPercent > 35) {
    warnings.push(`Total tax burden is X.X% - higher than typical 25-30%.`);
  }
  
  return { warnings, advisories };
}, [basePay, cola, fica, medicare, federalTax, stateTax]);
```

**UI Display:**
- **Red Warning Cards:** Math errors (FICA/Medicare incorrect, total >35%)
- **Yellow Advisory Cards:** Unusual but possibly correct (Federal too low/high)
- **Auto-fill Badge:** Green "✓ Auto-calc (6.2%)" label on FICA/Medicare fields
- **Blue Info Banner:** Explains auto-calculation at top of Taxes section

#### Cost Analysis:
- **Auto-calculation:** $0 (client-side JavaScript)
- **Real-time validation:** $0 (client-side JavaScript)
- **AI explanations:** ~$0.01 per audit (500 tokens, only when flagged)
- **Total per audit with tax issues:** ~$0.26 ($0.25 base + $0.01 AI explanation)

### Part 2: Ask Assistant Personalization

#### Files Modified:
1. **`lib/ask/data-query-engine.ts`**
   - Updated `queryOfficialSources()` to prioritize user profile data
   - Returns profile as FIRST data source for AI prompt
   - Fields: `user_id, paygrade, mha_or_zip, years_of_service, has_dependents, dependents_count, rank, branch`

2. **`app/api/ask/submit/route.ts`**
   - Updated `buildPrompt()` to detect user profile in context data
   - Added **explicit personalization instructions** to AI prompt
   - Added conditional prompt section when `hasUserProfile === true`
   - Includes user's actual rank, location, YOS, dependents in prompt
   - Added example good/bad responses to reinforce personalization

#### How It Works:

**Profile Query (First Priority):**
```typescript
// FIRST: Get user profile data
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('user_profiles')
  .select('user_id, paygrade, mha_or_zip, years_of_service, has_dependents, dependents_count, rank, branch')
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .maybeSingle();

// Add as data source for AI
if (profile) {
  sources.push({
    table: 'user_profile',
    source_name: 'User Profile',
    data: {
      paygrade: profile.paygrade,
      rank: profile.rank,
      mha_or_zip: profile.mha_or_zip,
      years_of_service: profile.years_of_service,
      has_dependents: profile.has_dependents,
      dependents_count: profile.dependents_count,
      branch: profile.branch
    }
  });
}
```

**AI Prompt Enhancement:**
```typescript
${hasUserProfile ? `
**CRITICAL: You have access to the user's actual profile data. Use it to personalize your answer.**

User Profile:
- Rank/Paygrade: ${userProfile?.data.rank || userProfile?.data.paygrade || 'Unknown'}
- Location (MHA/ZIP): ${userProfile?.data.mha_or_zip || 'Not set'}
- Years of Service: ${userProfile?.data.years_of_service || 'Unknown'}
- Dependents: ${userProfile?.data.has_dependents ? `Yes (${userProfile?.data.dependents_count || 1})` : 'No'}
- Branch: ${userProfile?.data.branch || 'Unknown'}

When answering:
1. Use their ACTUAL rank, location, and dependent status - not hypothetical examples
2. Say "Based on your profile" or "For you as an E-5 with dependents"
3. If they ask about "my BAH" or "my pay", use THEIR specific data from the sources below
4. If their profile is incomplete, tell them to update it at /dashboard/profile
5. DO NOT say "if you were an E-5" - they ARE what their profile says they are
` : ''}
```

**Example Transformation:**

❌ **Before (Generic):**
> "Based on the 2025 rates, if you were, for example, an E-5 with dependents stationed in El Paso, TX, your BAH would be $1,773.00 per month."

✅ **After (Personalized):**
> "Based on your profile (E-5 with dependents in El Paso, TX), your BAH for 2025 is $1,773 per month. This rate is effective January 1, 2025, and is designed to cover your housing costs in the El Paso area."

### Ask Assistant Personalization
- [x] Ensure profile has: rank (E-5), location (El Paso), dependents (Yes)
- [x] Ask: "What is my BAH?"
- [x] Verify answer says: "Based on your profile (E-5 with dependents in El Paso)..."
- [x] Verify NO "if you were" or "for example" phrasing
- [x] Ask: "How much is my base pay?"
- [x] Verify personalized response with actual rank from profile
- [x] Test with incomplete profile - should prompt to update at /dashboard/profile

## 🎯 What Users Will See

### LES Auditor Page (`/dashboard/paycheck-audit`)

**Before:**
- User enters Base Pay
- Taxes section is completely empty
- User manually calculates FICA and Medicare
- No validation feedback

**After:**
- User enters Base Pay
- ✨ **FICA auto-fills instantly at 6.2%**
- ✨ **Medicare auto-fills instantly at 1.45%**
- Blue banner explains: "FICA and Medicare are auto-calculated..."
- If user edits to wrong amount → Red warning with exact expected value
- If Federal tax seems unusual → Yellow advisory with typical range
- All fields editable (user can override if their LES differs)

### Ask Assistant Page (`/dashboard/ask`)

**Before:**
```
Q: "What is my BAH?"
A: "If you were, for example, an E-5 with dependents in El Paso, 
    your BAH would be $1,773/month."
```

**After:**
```
Q: "What is my BAH?"
A: "Based on your profile (E-5 with dependents in El Paso, TX), 
    your BAH for 2025 is $1,773 per month. This rate accounts for 
    your rank and dependent status."
```
