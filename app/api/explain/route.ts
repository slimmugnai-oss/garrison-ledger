5. Long-term perspective and what to watch for (1-2 sentences)

BAD (generic):
"Your TSP strategy looks good. Consider diversifying. Roth contributions may be beneficial."

GOOD (specific and detailed):
"<p>Your 70/30 C/S mix projects to <strong>\$727K at age 50</strong>—that's \$145K more than the default lifecycle fund. With 20 years until retirement and young kids to support, this aggressive stock-heavy stance makes sense because you have time to ride out market volatility. At your current contribution of \$500/month, you're outpacing 80% of service members and setting yourself up well.</p><p>Here's what's working: your allocation is heavy on growth (C and S funds), which historically return 10-11% annually. The lifecycle fund you'd be in (L2050) is only 70% stocks, which is too conservative for someone your age. You're effectively giving yourself an extra \$145K in retirement by being more aggressive now.</p><ul><li><strong>Max Roth TSP contributions now</strong> while you're likely in the 12% tax bracket—that \$727K becomes completely tax-free at 50, saving you \$150K+ in taxes vs traditional TSP if you're in a higher bracket later</li><li><strong>If you deploy, use the tax advantage strategically</strong>—temporarily boost contributions to 60% of base pay to max SDP at \$10K (guaranteed 10% return), then return to this allocation after redeployment</li><li><strong>Balance TSP with high-interest debt</strong>—if you have credit cards over 15% APR, pay those off first, but don't drop below 5% TSP contribution to keep the full BRS match (that's free money)</li><li><strong>Consider your timeline to 20 years</strong>—if you're planning to retire at 20 and need the money soon after, start shifting 10% to the F fund each year after year 15 to reduce volatility as you approach withdrawal</li></ul><p>With young kids and deployment uncertainty, make sure you have 3-6 months expenses in a high-yield savings account before maxing TSP. The TSP is great, but you can't touch it easily in emergencies. Also, with the BRS, you're getting that match plus the continuation pay—make sure you're taking full advantage of both.</p>"`,

  sdp: `Analyze SDP results. Give tactical, detailed advice. NO greetings.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Start with their payout amount and growth potential
- Reference deployment timeline and their specific situation
- Compare strategies with THEIR actual numbers
- Write 400-600 words of detailed, caring analysis
- Include specific examples and calculations
- Write like a knowledgeable military friend who has time to explain thoroughly
- Mention tax implications (SDP payout is taxable income)
- Clean HTML (<p>, <strong>, <ul><li>)

STRUCTURE:
1. Lead with their SDP payout and what it means (2-3 sentences)
2. Explain the power of the 10% guaranteed return in deployment context (full paragraph)
3. 3-5 tactical next steps with DETAILED guidance (use <ul><li>)
4. Tax strategy and timing considerations (full paragraph)
5. Long-term perspective and deployment planning (1-2 sentences)

GOOD example:
"<p>Your <strong>\$10K SDP payout grows to \$35K in 15 years</strong> with moderate 8% conservative investment returns—that's the power of deployment savings combined with smart post-deployment investing. The guaranteed 10% annual return while deployed is unbeatable and risk-free, way better than any civilian savings account. With a 9-month deployment, you're earning \$750 in interest alone, plus it compounds for 90 days after you return.</p><p>Here's why SDP is so powerful: you're getting a government-guaranteed 10% return while deployed, which is higher than the stock market's historical average, with zero risk. That \$10K becomes \$10,750 by the time you get home. No bank, no investment, nothing beats this for deployed service members. The key is what you do with it AFTER you get the payout.</p><ul><li><strong>Emergency fund FIRST</strong>—take \$15K of that payout and park it in a high-yield savings account (currently 4-5% APY) for 6 months of expenses. With young kids and deployment uncertainty, you need this safety net before investing anything else.</li><li><strong>Max your Roth IRA immediately</strong>—put \$7,000 in a Roth IRA THIS YEAR (you can contribute up to \$7K for 2025), then another \$7K on January 1st for 2026. That \$14K grows tax-free forever, and at 8% returns, becomes \$150K by retirement. This is HUGE because you're in a low tax bracket now during deployment (tax-free combat pay).</li><li><strong>Pay off high-interest debt strategically</strong>—if you have credit cards over 15% APR or car loans over 7%, pay those off BEFORE investing the rest. The guaranteed return of killing debt beats market returns.</li><li><strong>Put remaining funds in index funds</strong>—after emergency fund, Roth IRA, and debt, invest the rest in a simple S&P 500 index fund (like VOO or FXAIX). Don't try to time the market or pick stocks—just dollar-cost average in over 3 months.</li><li><strong>Don't touch this for 10+ years</strong>—with young kids and debt concerns, you'll be tempted to spend it. DON'T. This is your future financial security. Compound interest needs TIME to work.</li></ul><p>Tax reality check: your SDP payout is TAXABLE INCOME in the year you receive it. Plan for this—set aside 15-22% for federal taxes depending on your bracket. If you got \$10,750, expect to owe \$1,500-2,300 in taxes. Don't get surprised at tax time. The good news: if you're in a combat zone when you contribute, that income was tax-free, so you're only taxed on the interest portion.</p><p>If you're pre-deployment, start contributing NOW—max it out at \$10K by putting 60-70% of base pay into SDP early in deployment. The sooner you max it, the more interest you earn. And remember: interest accrues for 90 days after you redeploy, so time your withdrawal strategically.</p>"`,

  house: `Analyze house hacking numbers. Give tactical, detailed guidance. NO greetings.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Start with their cash flow verdict (positive/negative, actual monthly number)
- Reference PCS timeline and family situation deeply
- Be ULTRA-realistic about risks (vacancy, maintenance, property management, market conditions)
- Write 400-600 words of detailed, caring analysis
- Include specific examples and calculations
- 3-5 tactical next steps with DETAILED guidance
- Clean HTML (<p>, <strong>, <ul><li>)

STRUCTURE:
1. Lead with cash flow number and what it means realistically (2-3 sentences)
2. Break down the actual economics with their specific numbers (full paragraph)
3. 3-5 tactical next steps with DETAILED guidance (use <ul><li>)
4. Real risks and PCS/family considerations (full paragraph)
5. Final verdict on whether this makes sense for THEIR situation (1-2 sentences)

GOOD example:
"<p><strong>+\$450/month positive cash flow</strong> on paper—this property could pay you while building equity, but let's reality-check these numbers because there's a big difference between theoretical cash flow and actual money in your pocket. With a PCS coming in 6-12 months and young kids to manage, the timing is tight but potentially doable if you move fast and are realistic about the risks.</p><p>Here's the breakdown: your mortgage payment is \$1,800 (including taxes and insurance), you're estimating \$2,250/month in rent, which gives you that \$450 cushion. BUT reality is messier. Maintenance averages 1% of home value per year (that's \$200/month), vacancy averages 5-8% annually (another \$180/month), and property management is 8-10% of rent (\$225/month). When you factor in ALL the real costs, your \$450 positive cash flow drops to -\$155/month NEGATIVE. This is why most house hacking deals that look good on Zillow fall apart under scrutiny.</p><ul><li><strong>Talk to a VA lender THIS WEEK</strong>—rates are at 7% now and could hit 8% in 6 months. Get pre-approved immediately and lock your rate for 60 days. Also confirm you qualify for 0% down VA loan (you should based on service) and understand your BAH at the NEW duty station—if it's lower, that impacts your budget.</li><li><strong>Research ACTUAL rental rates, not Zillow</strong>—call 3-5 property managers in the area and ask what similar homes ACTUALLY rent for (not listed at, but ACTUALLY closed at). Zillow rent estimates are notoriously 15-20% optimistic. If real rent is \$1,900 instead of \$2,250, this deal goes from barely positive to deeply negative.</li><li><strong>Run the 1% rule stress test</strong>—monthly rent should be at least 1% of purchase price for cash flow positive deals. Your \$225K house needs \$2,250/month rent just to break even with all costs. You're right at the edge, which is risky.</li><li><strong>Budget for reality, not best-case</strong>—assume 10% vacancy (\$225/mo), 1% maintenance (\$200/mo), and 10% property management (\$225/mo). That's \$650/month in hidden costs. Your \$450 cushion doesn't cover this—you'd be -\$200/month negative unless rent is higher or mortgage is lower.</li><li><strong>Consider the long-distance landlord reality</strong>—when you PCS in 6-12 months, you're managing this property from 800 miles away with young kids. One emergency plumbing call at 10pm will cost you \$500 and massive stress. Property management is REQUIRED, not optional, which kills your cash flow.</li></ul><p>Real talk on PCS risk: if you PCS again in 3 years (which is likely in the military), you're a long-distance landlord for potentially your entire career. With young kids and deployment uncertainty, this adds stress you might not want. Also, if you HAVE to sell during a market downturn or can't find tenants, you're stuck with a -\$200/month loss every month until it sells. The VA loan is great because it's 0% down, but that also means you have almost no equity cushion if property values drop 5-10%.</p><p>Final verdict: this deal is marginal at best with your numbers. ONLY do this if: (1) you're committed to being a landlord long-term, (2) you verify rent is truly \$2,250+ and not Zillow fantasy, (3) you plan to stay at this base 3+ years or are OK losing \$200/month for a while, and (4) you have 6 months of emergency fund to cover vacancies. If any of those are no, walk away and just keep renting—there's no shame in that, and it's way less risky with a PCS coming up.</p>"`,

  "on-base-savings": `Analyze on-base savings results. Give tactical, detailed advice. NO greetings.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Start with total annual savings potential
- Break down commissary vs exchange vs benefits in detail
- Reference family situation deeply (kids = WAY more savings)
- Write 400-600 words of detailed, caring analysis
- Be realistic - savings estimates vary by shopping habits, but show the math
- 3-5 tactical next steps with specific examples
- Clean HTML (<p>, <strong>, <ul><li>)

STRUCTURE:
1. Lead with total savings and monthly impact (2-3 sentences)
2. Break down where the savings come from with their numbers (full paragraph)
3. 3-5 tactical next steps with DETAILED guidance (use <ul><li>)
4. Reality check and optimization tips (full paragraph)
5. Long-term perspective (1-2 sentences)

GOOD example:
"<p><strong>\$4,200/year potential savings</strong>—that's \$350/month back in your pocket just by strategically using on-base benefits instead of shopping exclusively off-base. With young kids, your commissary savings (\$2,400 annually) are your biggest win because families with children spend way more on meat, produce, and baby items where commissary prices crush civilian grocery stores.</p><p>Here's the breakdown: you're spending \$600/month on groceries total, and the commissary saves you an average of 25-30% on most items compared to civilian stores like Kroger or Safeway. On meat and produce specifically, the savings hit 30-35% because the commissary operates on a cost-plus model (they sell at cost + 5% surcharge) while civilian stores mark up 25-40%. Your \$200/month on meat/produce at commissary would cost \$300 off-base—that's \$1,200/year saved right there. Add in diapers, formula, and pantry staples, and you're looking at \$2,400 in commissary savings alone. Then you've got exchange tax savings (no sales tax = \$600/year on major purchases) and Military Star Card gas savings (5¢/gallon = \$100/year).</p><ul><li><strong>Do 100% of meat and produce at commissary</strong>—this is where you get the biggest bang for buck (30%+ savings). One weekly trip saves you \$100/month compared to off-base stores. With kids, you're buying lots of chicken breasts, ground beef, and fresh veggies—commissary prices are unbeatable on these.</li><li><strong>Stock up on diapers and formula during case lot sales</strong>—commissary case lot sales happen quarterly and offer an EXTRA 20-30% off already-low prices. If you buy 6 months of diapers during a case lot sale, you'll save \$300 compared to buying at Target or Amazon. Mark your calendar and buy in bulk.</li><li><strong>Use Military Star Card for ALL exchange and gas purchases</strong>—you get 5¢/gallon savings on gas (that's \$100/year if you drive 20,000 miles annually), PLUS you avoid sales tax on exchange purchases. A \$1,000 TV at Best Buy costs \$1,080 with tax—at the exchange with Star Card, it's \$1,000 flat. That's \$80 saved on one purchase.</li><li><strong>Compare prices on shelf-stable items</strong>—commissary isn't always cheaper on canned goods, pasta, or cereal. These items go on sale at civilian stores frequently and might beat commissary prices. Use the commissary for perishables and baby items, but shop sales at Kroger/Costco for pantry staples.</li><li><strong>Factor in the 5% surcharge and drive time</strong>—commissary adds a 5% surcharge to cover operating costs, and if you live 30 minutes from base, you're spending an extra hour roundtrip plus gas. Calculate if it's worth it—for a \$200 grocery trip saving \$60, yes. For a \$30 trip saving \$9, probably not worth the drive time.</li></ul><p>Reality check: \$4,200 assumes you do 100% of shopping on-base, which is rarely realistic unless you live on base or very close. Most families do 60-70% on-base and still save \$2,500-3,000/year, which is significant. The key is focusing on HIGH-IMPACT categories: meat, produce, diapers, formula, and major purchases (appliances, electronics). Don't waste time driving to base for a gallon of milk—save your commissary trips for the big weekly shop where you're buying \$150-200 of groceries.</p><p>Long-term: over 20 years of military service, using the commissary strategically saves \$50,000-80,000. That's a car, a down payment on a house, or a massive boost to your retirement savings. It's one of the best financial benefits you get as a service member—use it wisely.</p>"`,

  pcs: `Analyze PCS financial planner results. Give tactical, detailed advice. NO greetings.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Start with net estimate (income minus expenses) and what it means
- Reference DLA, per diem, PPM with their specific numbers
- Be ULTRA-realistic about timing, paperwork, and military bureaucracy
- Write 400-600 words of detailed, caring analysis
- 3-5 tactical next steps with DETAILED guidance
- Mention common mistakes and deadlines (critical for military moves)
- Clean HTML (<p>, <strong>, <ul><li>)

STRUCTURE:
1. Lead with net estimate and breakdown (2-3 sentences)
2. Explain entitlements and how they work with their numbers (full paragraph)
3. 3-5 tactical next steps with DETAILED guidance (use <ul><li>)
4. Common mistakes and deadline warnings (full paragraph)
5. HHG vs PPM decision guidance (1-2 sentences)

GOOD example:
"<p><strong>Net estimate: +\$2,400</strong> after all PCS entitlements and expenses—you should come out ahead financially if you execute this move smartly and don't miss any filing deadlines. Your DLA (\$3,500) and per diem (\$2,800) cover most costs, and if you do a PPM (Personally Procured Move), you could add another \$1,200, bringing your total surplus to \$3,600. BUT this assumes you file everything correctly and on time, which many troops don't do and lose thousands as a result.</p><p>Here's how the entitlements break down: DLA (Dislocation Allowance) is a flat \$3,500 for your rank (E-5) with dependents, designed to cover the random costs of moving like utility deposits, changing driver's licenses, and setting up your new place. You get this REGARDLESS of your actual expenses—it's yours to keep. Per diem is \$2,800 based on 7 travel days at \$200/day (includes meals and lodging) for your family. This reimburses actual travel costs, but if you're frugal (stay at cheaper hotels, eat at Chipotle instead of sit-down restaurants), you can pocket the difference. The PPM incentive of \$1,200 is 95% of what the military WOULD have paid professional movers—you get this if you move yourself and file the weight tickets correctly.</p><ul><li><strong>File DLA claim WITHIN 90 DAYS of PCS orders</strong>—this is the #1 mistake troops make. You have ONLY 90 days from your orders to file DLA through finance. Miss this deadline and you forfeit \$3,500. Set a calendar reminder for 60 days to give yourself a buffer. Go to finance in person if possible—don't trust email.</li><li><strong>Save EVERY receipt for everything</strong>—lodging, rental truck, gas, tolls, food, moving supplies, EVERYTHING. Per diem is yours regardless, but if you get audited (happens to 10% of PCS moves), you need receipts to prove your travel costs. Store receipts in a dedicated folder and take photos as backup. Also save weight tickets if doing PPM—those are REQUIRED, not optional.</li><li><strong>Do the PPM math honestly</strong>—\$1,200 incentive sounds great, but let's reality-check: U-Haul truck rental for 1,200 miles = \$800, gas for truck = \$600, lodging for 3 nights with family = \$450, moving supplies (boxes, tape, dolly) = \$200, total cost = \$2,050. Your PPM payment is \$1,200, so you're NET NEGATIVE \$850. The only way PPM makes sense is if you have friends/family who help for free, you already own a truck, or you're moving a tiny apartment. For a 3-bedroom house with kids, PPM is usually MORE expensive and WAY more stressful than HHG (professional movers).</li><li><strong>Book lodging NOW if PCS is in summer</strong>—June-August are peak PCS season, and hotels near military bases book up 2-3 months out. If you wait until the last minute, you'll pay \$200/night instead of \$120/night, killing your per diem profit. Book refundable rooms now and adjust dates later if orders change.</li><li><strong>Understand MALT vs actual costs for driving</strong>—if you drive your POV (personally owned vehicle), you get MALT (Monetary Allowance in Lieu of Transportation) which is \$0.18/mile. For 1,200 miles, that's \$216. But gas alone will cost you \$300-400 for that distance. MALT doesn't fully cover driving costs—it's a partial reimbursement, not profit. Don't count on making money driving your car cross-country.</li></ul><p>Common mistakes that cost troops thousands: (1) missing the 90-day DLA deadline (\$3,500 lost), (2) not getting weight tickets for PPM (\$1,200 lost), (3) not saving lodging receipts and getting audited (could owe back \$2,800), (4) filing paperwork wrong and having to resubmit 3 times (delays payment by months). The military WILL pay you what you're entitled to, but ONLY if you file correctly and on time. Their job is to follow regulations, not hunt you down to give you money.</p><p>HHG vs PPM decision: with young kids and a cross-country move, HHG (professional movers) is almost always better unless you have a very small load or free help. Yes, you give up the \$1,200 PPM incentive, but you also avoid: (1) lifting heavy furniture with a back injury risk, (2) driving a 26-foot truck you've never driven before, (3) dealing with kids in a cramped truck cab for 3 days, (4) unloading in 95-degree heat. Your time and sanity are worth more than \$1,200. Do HHG and use that time to get settled at your new base.</p>"`,

5. Final recommendation based on their situation (1-2 sentences)

GOOD example:
"<p><strong>\$75,000 in Austin = \$95,000 in San Diego</strong> to maintain the exact same lifestyle—you'd need a 27% raise just to break even financially. The new job offer of \$85,000 sounds like a raise, but it's actually a PAY CUT in real purchasing power terms because you're losing \$10,000/year in buying power due to San Diego's insane housing costs and California state taxes.</p><p>Here's the brutal breakdown: Austin rent for a decent 3BR house in a good school district is \$2,400/month. In San Diego, that same quality of housing costs \$3,600/month minimum—that's an extra \$14,400/year just in rent. Then there's California state income tax at 9.3% on income over \$61K, which costs you \$7,000/year, while Texas has ZERO state income tax. Add in higher gas prices (\$5.50/gallon vs \$3.20 in TX = \$1,200/year more), higher car insurance (\$2,400/year vs \$1,400 in TX), and higher sales tax (7.75% vs 6.25%), and you're bleeding an extra \$25,000/year in San Diego just to live the same lifestyle. That Austin \$75K salary has the buying power of \$95K in San Diego—your \$85K offer is \$10K SHORT of break-even.</p><ul><li><strong>Negotiate the offer to \$95K minimum</strong>—show them this cost-of-living analysis and explain you need \$95K just to break even with your current Austin lifestyle. If they can't budge past \$85K, you're taking a real \$10K pay cut to move. Many companies have COL adjustment budgets for relocations—ask for it.</li><li><strong>Housing will EAT your budget</strong>—in San Diego, \$3,600/month is the floor for a 3BR in a safe area with decent schools. In Austin, \$2,400 gets you a nice house. That's \$1,200/month or \$14,400/year difference. If you downsize to a 2BR apartment in San Diego to save money, you're sacrificing living space for your family, which impacts quality of life with young kids.</li><li><strong>CA tax bite is permanent</strong>—9.3% state income tax is \$7,000/year GONE forever. Texas has no state income tax, so your \$75K in Austin = \$81,000 take-home, while \$85K in San Diego = \$73,000 take-home after CA taxes. You're literally making LESS money after taxes despite the higher salary number.</li><li><strong>Research schools THOROUGHLY</strong>—San Diego Unified has some great schools (Torrey Pines, La Jolla High) but also some struggling ones. Austin ISD has excellent schools (Westlake, Lake Travis) too. Don't assume San Diego = better schools just because it's California. Check GreatSchools ratings for specific neighborhoods you can afford on \$85K.</li><li><strong>Factor in career growth trajectory</strong>—is this San Diego job a stepping stone to \$120K+ in 2-3 years? If yes, maybe the short-term pay cut is worth it for long-term growth. If it's a lateral move with no clear path to higher comp, you're just accepting less money for beach access.</li></ul><p>Non-financial reality check: San Diego has perfect weather (70°F year-round, no humidity) and beach access, while Austin has brutal summers (100°F+ for months) and no ocean. With young kids, beach weekends and outdoor activities year-round are huge quality of life wins. HOWEVER, if your parents/family are in Austin and provide free childcare or emotional support, moving to San Diego means you're alone 1,500 miles away—that's stressful with kids. Also consider: Austin's tech scene is BOOMING (Tesla, Oracle, Apple all there), while San Diego's job market is smaller. If you lose this San Diego job, finding another comparable role might be harder than in Austin.</p><p>Final recommendation: this move only makes sense financially if you can negotiate to \$95K+, or if the non-financial factors (beach lifestyle, specific career opportunity, family already in San Diego) are worth a \$10K/year pay cut. If money is your priority, stay in Austin. If quality of life and beach access are worth \$10K/year to you, move to San Diego but know what you're signing up for financially.</p>"`,

GOOD example:
"<p><strong>Total comp difference: +\$32,000/year</strong> for the new role (\$95K base + \$15K bonus + \$10K equity vs. current \$88K total)—that's a 36% raise on paper and sounds incredible. BUT location matters: the new city has 15% higher cost of living, which eats \$10K of that gain, reducing your REAL purchasing power increase to \$22K/year. Still significant, but not as amazing as it first appears.</p><p>Here's the compensation breakdown you need to understand: your current role pays \$75K base + \$13K benefits (health insurance, 401k match) = \$88K total. The new role pays \$95K base + \$15K annual bonus (vesting quarterly, 75% guaranteed) + \$10K equity (4-year vest with 1-year cliff) + \$12K benefits = \$132K total on paper. BUT equity is only worth something if the company IPOs or gets acquired, which statistically happens to <5% of startups. So realistic comp is \$95K + \$15K + \$12K = \$122K guaranteed. That's \$34K more than current, minus \$10K COL adjustment = \$24K real gain after accounting for higher rent/taxes in the new city.</p><ul><li><strong>Evaluate equity REALISTICALLY</strong>—\$10K/year in stock options sounds great, but with a 4-year vest and 1-year cliff, you get ZERO equity if you leave before year 1, and only 25% if you leave after year 2. Plus, if the company doesn't IPO (90% chance it won't), those options are worthless. Don't count on equity as real money—treat it as a lottery ticket and focus on base + bonus.</li><li><strong>Calculate hourly rate for workload expectations</strong>—if the new role is \$122K but expects 60 hours/week (standard at startups), your hourly rate is \$39/hour. Your current role at \$88K for 40 hours/week is \$42/hour. You'd be making LESS per hour despite higher total comp. With young kids and deployment stress, is working 50% more hours worth 38% more money? Your family time has value too.</li><li><strong>Industry risk matters</strong>—tech startups have high growth potential (\$150K+ in 3 years if company scales) but also high failure risk (60% of startups fold within 3 years). Your current stable job in defense contracting is boring but recession-proof. With a mortgage and kids, can you afford a 12-month job search if the startup implodes?</li><li><strong>Career trajectory analysis</strong>—the new role as Senior Engineer opens doors to Staff Engineer (\$180K+) or Engineering Manager (\$200K+) paths within 2-3 years IF the company grows. Your current role caps at Senior Engineer II (\$110K max) with no management path. Long-term, the new role has 2x the upside, but only if you execute well and the company survives.</li><li><strong>Negotiate the offer</strong>—you have leverage because they want you. Ask for \$105K base instead of \$95K (they'll likely say yes because tech companies have hiring budgets). That extra \$10K/year compounds over your career—over 20 years at 3% raises, that's \$300K+ in extra earnings. ALWAYS negotiate, especially in tech.</li></ul><p>Career trajectory reality: this new role is higher risk but higher reward. If you're risk-averse (military background suggests you might be), the stable defense job is safer. If you're ambitious and willing to bet on yourself, the startup could 5x your compensation in 5 years—but it could also fold and leave you scrambling for a new job. With young kids, deployment uncertainty, and a mortgage, ask yourself: can you handle 3-6 months of job hunting if this doesn't work out? Do you have 6-12 months of emergency fund? If yes, take the risk. If no, the stable job might be smarter.</p><p>Final recommendation: if you can negotiate to \$105K base and you have 6+ months emergency fund, take the new role—the upside justifies the risk and you're young enough to recover if it fails. If they won't budge from \$95K or you don't have savings cushion, stay at your current job and keep interviewing—better offers will come. Don't make a risky career move from a position of financial weakness.</p>"`,
