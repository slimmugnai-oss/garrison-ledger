**Complete implementation guide for integrating Garrison Ledger CTAs into your Family Media toolkit pages.**

---

## 📋 **WHAT'S INCLUDED**

This integration package contains:
- ✅ **Shared CSS styles** (consistent branding)
- ✅ **Sticky assessment banner** (top of every page)
- ✅ **Page-specific CTA boxes** (5 pages × 2-3 CTAs each)

---

## 🎯 **QUICK START (5 MINUTES PER PAGE)**

### **Step 1: Add Shared Styles (ONE TIME)**

Copy the entire contents of `shared-styles.html` into the `<head>` section of each toolkit page template.

**Location:** Between `<head>` and `</head>` tags

**Why:** This ensures consistent branding, smooth animations, and mobile responsiveness across all CTAs.

---

### **Step 2: Add Sticky Banner**

Copy the banner from `sticky-banner.html` and paste it **immediately after** the opening `<body>` tag.

**Remember to replace:** `REPLACE_WITH_PAGE` with the correct page identifier:
- `pcs_hub`
- `career_hub`
- `base_guides`
- `on_base_shopping`
- `deployment_guide`

**Example for PCS Hub:**
```html
<body>
  <!-- PASTE BANNER HERE -->
  <div class="gl-banner">
    <span class="gl-banner-text">💡 Want a personalized plan based on YOUR situation?</span>
    <a href="https://app.familymedia.com/dashboard/assessment?utm_source=pcs_hub&utm_medium=sticky_banner&utm_campaign=toolkit_integration" 
       class="gl-banner-link">
      Take our 2-minute assessment →
    </a>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Rest of your page content -->
</body>
```

---

### **Step 3: Add CTAs to Each Page**

Each toolkit page has its own dedicated CTA file. Open the file and copy the CTAs that make the most sense for your content flow.

6. **Resource Finder Widget** → Place mid-page or resources section

---

### **Step 4: Add Inline Links (Optional but Recommended)**

Each CTA file includes "INLINE LINK EXAMPLES" that you can embed directly into your existing content paragraphs.

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Your existing paragraph -->
<p>
  Creating a detailed PCS budget is your first line of defense against unexpected costs.
</p>

<!-- Enhanced with inline link -->
<p>
  Creating a detailed PCS budget is your first line of defense against unexpected costs. 
  <a href="https://app.familymedia.com/dashboard/tools/house-hacking?utm_source=pcs_hub&utm_medium=inline_link&utm_campaign=budget" 
     class="gl-inline-link">Use our interactive calculator</a> 
  to model different scenarios and see exactly where your money will go.
</p>
```

**Pro Tip:** These are most effective when they naturally extend the value of your existing content.

## 📊 **UTM TRACKING EXPLAINED**

Every link includes UTM parameters for Google Analytics tracking. Here's what they mean:

### **utm_source** (Which page)
- `pcs_hub`
- `career_hub`
- `base_guides`
- `on_base_shopping`
- `deployment_guide`

### **utm_medium** (What type of link)
- `sticky_banner` - Top sticky banner
- `cta_box` - Large gradient CTA box
- `inline_link` - Text link within content
- `widget` - Interactive widget CTA

### **utm_campaign** (Specific purpose)
- `toolkit_integration` - General banner
- `tsp_calculator` - TSP tool
- `sdp_calculator` - SDP tool
- `house_hacking` - House hacking tool
- `assessment` - Main assessment
- (and many more specific to each link)

### **How to Use This Data**

In Google Analytics 4:
1. Go to **Reports** → **Acquisition** → **Traffic acquisition**
2. Add secondary dimension: **Session source / medium**
3. Filter by source containing "familymedia.com"
4. See exactly which toolkit pages and which CTAs drive the most conversions

**Example insights you'll get:**
- "PCS Hub sticky banner drives 35% of all assessment starts"
- "SDP calculator CTA on Deployment Guide has 12% click-through rate"
- "Inline links in Career Hub convert 3x better than widgets"

## 🚀 **ROLLOUT STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: High-Impact Pages (Week 1)**

5. **Base Guides** → Housing Calculator + Assessment

### **Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3+)**
Based on analytics data:
- Remove low-performing CTAs

## ✅ **TESTING CHECKLIST**

Before going live, test each page:

### **Desktop**
- [ ] Banner appears at top and stays sticky
- [ ] CTA boxes display gradient correctly
- [ ] Buttons have hover effects
- [ ] Links are clickable and go to correct URLs
- [ ] Widgets render properly

### **Mobile**
- [ ] Banner text is readable (might stack on small screens)
- [ ] CTA boxes are full-width and readable
- [ ] Buttons are tappable (not too small)
- [ ] Inline links are easy to tap
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling

- [ ] Color contrast is good (WCAG AA compliant)
- [ ] No broken links
- [ ] Page load time not significantly impacted

---

## 🆘 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Issue: CTAs don't look right (no gradient, wrong colors)**
**Solution:** Make sure you copied the `shared-styles.html` into the `<head>` section.

### **Issue: Banner covers page header**
**Solution:** Add top padding to your page:
```css
body {
  padding-top: 50px;
}
```

### **Issue: Links don't work**
**Solution:** Check that you didn't accidentally break the href by adding line breaks inside the quotes.

### **Issue: Mobile looks broken**
**Solution:** Ensure viewport meta tag is present:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

### **Issue: Analytics not tracking**
**Solution:** 
1. Verify UTM parameters are present in URLs
2. Wait 24-48 hours for data to populate
3. Check Google Analytics 4 is properly set up
