Subject: Garrison Ledger Launch - Need Vercel Config Update

Hi Danny,

I've built a new premium financial planning app called Garrison Ledger for military families. It's ready to launch and I need your help with the Vercel configuration on familymedia.com.

This will:
âœ… Keep all toolkit pages on familymedia.com for SEO (good for us)
âœ… Give me full control to update content and app features (good for me)
âœ… Create a seamless user experience across both sites

WHAT I NEED:

Add this configuration to familymedia.com's vercel.json file:

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/pcs-hub",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/pcs-hub",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/career-hub",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/career-hub",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/deployment",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/deployment",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/on-base-shopping",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/on-base-shopping",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/base-guides",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/base-guides",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/dashboard/:path*",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/dashboard/:path*",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/assessment/:path*",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/assessment/:path*",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/tools/:path*",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/tools/:path*",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/sign-in/:path*",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/sign-in/:path*",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/sign-up/:path*",
      "destination": "https://app.familymedia.com/sign-up/:path*",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

WHAT THIS DOES:

301 Redirects (permanent, SEO-friendly):
- familymedia.com/pcs-hub â†’ app.familymedia.com/pcs-hub
- familymedia.com/career-hub â†’ app.familymedia.com/career-hub
- (same for deployment, on-base-shopping, base-guides)
- familymedia.com/dashboard â†’ app.familymedia.com/dashboard
- (same for assessment, tools, sign-in, sign-up)

BENEFITS:
âœ… Users type familymedia.com URLs (shorter, simpler)
âœ… Google passes SEO value to new locations (95%+ within 4 weeks)
âœ… All existing backlinks continue to work
âœ… I can update content instantly without involving you

TIMELINE:
Whenever you have 15 minutes this week works great. No rush!

If your vercel.json already has other config, just merge the "redirects" array into it.

Thanks!
```
